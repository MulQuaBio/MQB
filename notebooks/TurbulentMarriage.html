<h2>Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>Few would hesitate in identifying ecology and evolutionary biology as distinct field of research with somwhat disparate goals. In this  chapter, we will examine the alliance between these two, which have been distinct programs of research for more than a century now. In particular, we will focus on the most theoretically and empirically tangible part of this alliance: the unification of population ecology and population genetics.</p>
<p>We are generally taught Ecological and Evoluonary theory and practice separately; one need only flip though an introductory text in biology to see how well-established this separation is. Indeed, a majority of the practitioners of either discipline continue to conduct research with limited perspectives from the other, perhaps, albeit subliminally, taking the stance of the King of Hearts in Alice quoted above! In this introductory chapter we will examine whether this lack of collaboration hinders each discipline’s progress, what the roots for discord are, and the current status of the collaboration (the “Marriage”).</p>
<p>This is an appropriate time to make this evaluation, as the last two decades decade or so in particular have seen a resurgence of theoretical and empirical work that combines ecological and evolutionary concepts, theory and empirical data (and apporaches, driven by advances in molecular bilogy and muti-omics). Another, more philosophical motivation for this chapter is that ecology and evolution have been noticeably underrepresented in accounts of the philosophy of biology <span id="id1">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id134" title="Marjorie Grene and David Depew.

<p>Ecology today comprises a heterogeneous array of disciplines, transcending levels of complexity from individuals and populations at one end to ecosystems at the other. An attempt to examine the role of evolutionary biology at each of these and vice versa is beyond the scope of this Chapter. We will therefore focus mainly on two fields that form the traditional foundation of ecology and evolutionary biology, and which have a long history of exchange and attempted union: population biology and population genetics. Nevertheless, instances where such a union has obvious implications for higher levels of complexity will be dwelt upon.</p>

<p>Ecology today covers a wide range of topics ranging from the level of the individual, to ecosystems. This naturally implies a varied set of objectives, but a common underlying theme can still be identified as being along the lines of what the inventor of the term Haeckel (see below) originally defined it: the relationship between organisms and their environment. These two elements also comprise distinct ways in which things “ecological” are taken to mean: to some, ecology is synonymous with the characteristics of individuals, populations, communities or ecosystems of organisms, while to others, ecology is the environment that affects the organisms. This environment of course, can be biotic as well as abiotic. Disciplines in contemporary ecology are largely devoted to analyses of patterns observed in nature, their origins, and their changes with respect to the environment. Compared to evolutionary biology, ecology tends to dwell more in the present, its practitioners being most concerned with the relationship between organisms and their biotic as well as abiotic environment in “ecological time scales” (temporal scales in the order of one of few generations of the studied organisms). The common approach used to study these aspects is a mechanistic, physical one, with a tacit assumption of purely non-evolutionary response, and without consideration of the genetic variation (Mayr 1997)(pp. 210-211). Relative to evolutionary biology, the hope for general principles that govern these relationships have spurred the development of very detailed analyses of organism-environment interactions.</p>
<p>Evolutionary biology on the other hand, consists of both prospective and retrospective theoretical frameworks that are concerned with the origins of, and changes in living entities over varying time scales. At one end lies the mathematical theory of genetics that forms a basis for microevolutionary (evolution on relatively short temporal scales) research. At the same time, the fecund collaboration of molecular biology and classical evolutionary theory (Huxley 1942) now also contributes to macroevolutionary (evolution over longer, generally geological time scales) research through an increasing collaboration between phylogenetics, systematics, and paleontology. I now present a brief historical background with the objective of exploring the roots of discord as well as collaboration between these two disciplines.</p>

<p>(quoted in <span id="id7">Stauffer and Stauffer [<a class="reference internal" href="#id132" title="R C Robert C Stauffer and B Y Robert C Stauffer. Haeckel, Darwin, and ecology. Q. Rev. Biol., 32(2):138–144, 1957.">1957</a>]</span>).</p>
<p>Naturally, the first step towards achieving this goal was to study the effect of the environment on individuals and populations.</p>
<p>The period from Haeckel’s definition to the early 19th century was a crucial period for the discipline, although the term “ecology” was not used much. This was when the tradition of detailed botanical and zoological study of morphology, anatomy and physiology of the individual in relation to its adaptive environment was established. This was also the period when Herbert Spencer published his ideas about the emergence of order in nature <span id="id8">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id133" title="Herbert Spencer. The principles of biology. William and Norgate, London etc., 1864.">Spencer, 1864</a>]</span>. Spencer’s writings strongly influenced the approach of future generations by embedding the notion of stability and the “balance of nature” in the ecological psyche. By the beginning of the 20th century, when the units of study in ecology had already been defined at multiple levels beyond the individual (population, communities, ecosystems, etc), and population as well as community ecology we coming to the fore as distinct disciplines, a strong belief in the equilibrium state of nature and its units had already taken hold. This was followed by the adoption of a physical view by many ecologists, wherein living units were transformers of energy enmeshed in larger systems with considerable resilience to perturbation, and where details of the evolutionary process could be glossed in interest of a more systemic approach <span id="id9">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id130" title="Sharon E Kingsland. Modeling nature episodes in the history of population ecology. University of Chicago Press, Chicago, 1985.">Kingsland, 1985</a>]</span>(“The beginnings of “systems ecology””; pp. 34-49)</p>
<p>Apart from the systems approach to ecology, this was also the period when faith in the pre-adaptation of species and the slowness of evolution took firm hold. These beliefs freed the ecologist of evolutionary concerns, and allowed a single-minded commitment to the study of the nature of the adaptations in relation to the environment. The roots of the viewpoint that ecology and evolution operate at vastly different time scales are probably to be found in fact that including Darwin’s work, early evolutionary ideas were based on the fossil record, and tended to be “gradualist” <span id="id10">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id128" title="Steven M Stanley, J Roughgarden, RM May, and SA Levin. Fossils, macroevolution, and theoretical ecology. Perspectives in ecological theory, pages 125–134, 1989.">Stanley <em>et al.</em>, 1989</a>]</span>.

<div><p>I do believe that natural selection will generally act very slowly, only at long intervals of time, and only on a few of the inhabitants of the same region. I further believe that these slow, intermittent results accord well with what geology tells us of the rate and manner at which the inhabitants of the world have changed.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>This view was reinforced by the fact that examples of natural life tangible to early observers mostly happened to be relatively long-lived vertebrates. In contrast, modern biologists we can see evolution in action due to advances in molecular and phenotyping technologies, especially in microbial populations (something we will revisit later in this chapter). Thus, in its development through the first part of the 20th century, the rapidly proliferating branches of ecology had largely diverged from evolutionary biology with only sporadic exchange between the two disciplines. Ecologists during time focused increasingly on the effect of the abiotic environment and biotic interactions on populations to the exclusion of any considerations of genetics or evolution, trying to deal with the onerous task of defining the characteristics and emergent properties of the various levels from individuals to ecosystems.</p>

<p>Both population ecology and population genetics had, and still do, the same mathematical foundations at their core. For example, consider the case of an asexual haploid population with discrete, non-overlapping generations. Let time be measured in generations, such that population size at time <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t\)</span>, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(N(t)\)</span>, is the result of the previous generation’s population size, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(N(t-1)\)</span> multiplied by a growth factor which combines survival and reproduction, say <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(w\)</span>:</p>

<p>This is the familiar equation of exponential population growth.

This illustrates the interchangeability of the core concepts in population genetics and ecology, under some assumptions.</p>

In part, this was because the extensions of models such as eqns. <a class="reference internal" href="#equation-eq-turbulent-lv-competition">()</a> by themselves posed mathematical challenges without introducing the added complexity of genetics. Another reason is that these early voices of evolutionary ecology were drowned in the clamor created by the rapid proliferation of ecological subdisciplines <span id="id19">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id130" title="Sharon E Kingsland. Modeling nature episodes in the history of population ecology. University of Chicago Press, Chicago, 1985.">Kingsland, 1985</a>]</span>. For example, Gause, who was clearly motivated by Darwin’s theory (see introductory remarks in <span id="id20">Gause [<a class="reference internal" href="#id145" title="G F Gause.

Modeling nature episodes in the history of population ecology. University of Chicago Press, Chicago, 1985.">Kingsland, 1985</a>]</span>(p. 160). A rare example of such work appears to be that of V. A. Kostinzin, whose efforts however passed largely unnoticed, and were cut short by the Second World War <span id="id22">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id130" title="Sharon E Kingsland.

<p>On the other hand, the direction taken by evolutionary theorists during the early 20th century also resulted in disassociation from many aspects of ecology. The foundations of Mendelian population genetics were built by a bare-bones approach of achieving mathematical tractability by judicious approximation and selective omission of ecological reality. For instance, as shown above (and you will learn more about later), approximation of the Malthusian parameter <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(r\)</span> by the selection coefficient <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(s\)</span> involved (and still does in classical population genetics theory) the assumption of a fixed population size. The Hardy-Weinberg theorem (next Chapter) served as a useful model by allowing an estimation of expected allele frequencies in diploid populations under assumption of panmictic, random mating, infinitely sized populations that experience no selection, mutation, emigration or immigration. A relaxation of different assumptions then allowed a modeling of the various agents of evolution, an approach that is still used in classical population genetics.</p>
<p>For example, a traditional approach to modeling the role of natural selection in a diploid sexual population is to track the changes in allele frequencies for a single locus and two alleles. Consider two alleles <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(1\)</span> &amp; <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(2\)</span>, with frequencies <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(p\)</span> &amp; <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(q\)</span>, respectively. Assume an infinite population size, which assures that there is no random loss of alleles (no genetic drift), and that the condition of fixed population size derived in eqns. <a class="reference internal" href="#equation-eq-turbulent-fitness">()</a> - <a class="reference internal" href="#equation-eq-turbulent-exponential-growth">()</a> is satisfied. Furthermore, assume completely random mating followed by selective mortality, such that zygotes in every generation are in Hardy-Weinberg (HW) proportions of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(p^2\)</span>, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(2pq\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(q^2\)</span> before selection. Denoting population sizes of the three genotypes as <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(N_{11}\)</span>, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(N_{12}\)</span>, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(N_{22}\)</span>, and assigning fitnesses <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(w_{11}\)</span>, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(w_{12}\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(w_{22}\)</span> (loss of zygotes from mortality followed by reproductive gain) respectively, the number of individuals of each genotype in the next generation are, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(N_{11}' = w_{11} N_{11}\)</span>, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(N_{12}' = w_{12} N_{12}\)</span>, and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(N_{22}' = w_{22} N_{22}\)</span>. Then the frequency of allele <em>1</em> in the next generation is,</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\begin{split}\begin{align}
    p' &amp;= \frac{N_{11}' + \tfrac12 N_{12}'}{N_{11}' + N_{12}' + N_{22}'}\\
       &amp;= \frac{w_{11}N_{11} + w_{12}\tfrac12N_{12}}
       {w_{11}N_{11} + w_{12}N_{12} + w_{22}N_{22}}\\
       &amp;= \frac{w_{11}p^{2} + w_{12}pq}
         {w_{11}p^{2} + w_{12}\bigl(2pq\bigr) + w_{22}q^{2}}.
\end{align}\end{split}\]</div>
<p>Now, dividing through by <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(w_{11}\)</span> adds the convenience of reducing the fitnesses to dimensionless quantities by redefining them <em>relative</em> to fitness of the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(w11\)</span> genotype. The percentage advantage or disadvantage can then be denoted by the coefficient of selection, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(s\)</span> which appeared in an <em>absolute</em> context in eqn. <a class="reference internal" href="#equation-eq-turbulent-fitness-2">()</a> above. For example, assuming a multiplicative fitness scheme,<br />
$<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\begin{array}
    W_{11} &amp;= \frac{w_{11}}{w_{11}} = 1,\\
    W_{12} &amp;= \frac{w_{12}}{w_{11}} = 1 - s,\\
    W_{22} &amp;= \frac{w_{22}}{w_{11}} = (1 - s)^{2}.
\end{array} \)</span>$</p>
<p>Plugging these fitness values into eqn. <a class="reference internal" href="#equation-eq-turbulent-fitness">()</a> and remembering that <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(q = 1 - p\)</span>, yields after some algebraic manipulation,</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[
\Delta p = p' - p 
  = p(1 - p) \frac{s}{ 1 - s + s p }.
\]</div>
<p>Thus by introducing relative fitnesses, and retaining all other, albeit ecologically unrealistic assumptions for HW equilibrium, a simple two parameter model of natural selection can be analyzed. The issue of population size and the manner in which fitness is measured, are important issues in the marriage of population biology and population genetics, and will be considered in the next section. Furthermore, population geneticists during this period increasingly channeled their efforts towards extending one locus two allele cases towards more genetically realistic multi-locus models involving epistasis and genetic recombination <span id="id24">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id197" title="William B Provine. The origins of theoretical population genetics. University of Chicago Press, Chicago, 2001.">Provine, 2001</a>]</span>. For mathematical tractability, this had to be at the cost of ecological reality such as demographic fluctuations and environmental heterogeneity, topics very much at the heart of ecological research.</p>
<p>Evolutionary theory was not entirely oblivious to ecological reality though, and two distinct topics in particular impinged on evolutionary thought. One was demography, the evolutionary importance of which was championed by <span id="id25">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id127" title="Charles S Elton. Animal ecology and evolution. The Clarendon press, Oxford, 1930.">Elton, 1930</a>]</span>, and the other was ecological heterogeneity and niche partitioning, on which Gause <span id="id26">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id145" title="G F Gause. Experimental analysis of vito volterra's mathematical theory of the struggle for existence. Science, 79(2036):16–17, January 1934.">Gause, 1934</a>]</span> did seminal ecological work, and which really came to the fore in evolutionary ecology with Lack’s work on the Galapagos finches in the 1940’s <span id="id27">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id126" title="David Lambert Lack. Darwin's finches. University Press, Cambridge Eng., 1947.">Lack, 1947</a>]</span>. In the “Causes of Evolution” Haldane paid some attention to conjectures by <span id="id28">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id127" title="Charles S Elton. Animal ecology and evolution. The Clarendon press, Oxford, 1930.">Elton, 1930</a>]</span> and other evolutionary-minded ecologists about the role of finite population size and random extinction in evolution, but concluded that these factors had a minor role to play <span id="id29">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id191" title="J B S Haldane. The causes of evolution. Longmans, Green and co, London, 1932.">Haldane, 1932</a>]</span>(pp. 201-204). By the 1930’s, groundwork had been laid for modeling the effects of finite population sizes and spatial heterogeneity <span id="id30">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id160" title="Ronald A Fisher. The genetical theory of natural selection. Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1930.">Fisher, 1930</a>, <a class="reference internal" href="#id191" title="J B S Haldane. The causes of evolution. Longmans, Green and co, London, 1932.">Haldane, 1932</a>]</span>, which was developed further by the succeeding generation of population geneticists using stochastic theory. Wright’s “Shifting Balance Theory” for evolution, which invokes both finite population sizes and spatial heterogeneity is perhaps the most ecologically realistic population genetics theory coming from an evolutionary theorist of the period <span id="id31">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id170" title="Sewall Wright.

It is worth noting that by the early 20th century, the two aspects of ecology mentioned above, i.e., the study of populations, and the study of the environment, were clearly being given different weightage by different scientists in ecology and evolutionary biology. This is discussed further below, and it will be seen in the next section that this fact has had a strong impact on how evolutionary ecology or the synthesis of population biology and genetics is pursued today.</p>

<p>{cite:t}(Kingsland1985)(pp. 143-144) observes that there was a widespread disinterest apparent in the activities and views of ecologists and evolutionary biologists towards the other field from the 1920’s into the 1950’s. From closely entwined origins, ecology and evolutionary biology had diverged in many respects, resulting in deep-rooted cultural differences<a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id202" id="id32" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>6<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a>. The historical background above indicates various factors that contributed to the divergence of the two fields. Most of these persist today, and will be considered in more detail in the next section.</p>
<p>Around 1950, a renewed awareness of the chasm that had developed between evolutionary biology and ecology arose, with work such as David Lack’s research on the Galapagos finches reiterating the importance of ecological heterogeneity, biotic interactions, and niche partitioning <span id="id33">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id126" title="David Lambert Lack. Darwin's finches. University Press, Cambridge Eng., 1947.">Lack, 1947</a>]</span>. A shift away from the essentially equilibrium “balance of nature” view also played an important part in this. While a large body of ecologists continued to pursue the program of physical ecology involving detailed studies of the interface between the environment and ecological units ranging from individual to whole ecosystems <span id="id34">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id125" title="Alfred J Lotka.

MacArthur’s other work was also very influential, and within a short period of less than two decades, he initiated considerable shifts in the ecological community’s viewpoints about theory as well as empirical work <span id="id36">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id130" title="Sharon E Kingsland. Modeling nature episodes in the history of population ecology. University of Chicago Press, Chicago, 1985.">Kingsland, 1985</a>]</span>. He made many contributions to the theoretical fusion of population genetics and population biology, and had a big impact in drawing the attention of the ecologists towards evolutionary thinking. As Rosenzweig <span id="id37">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id123" title="M L Rosenzweig. No Title. Evol. Ecol., 1:1–3, 1987.">Rosenzweig, 1987</a>]</span> says,</p>

<div><p><em>MacArthur’s greatest contribution may have been that he seems to have got through to ecologists that they ignore evolution at the peril of missing the most predictive aspects and beguiling issues in ecology.</em></p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Additionally, the interface between genetics and ecology was also beginning to be seen as an exciting and important area of theoretical and empirical work as the discovery of the genetic code, and advances in bio-molecular techniques allowed hitherto impossible quantification of genetic variation in nature <span id="id38">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id194" title="E B Ford.

<p>Naturally, these forays into evolutionary ecology reflected the difference in approach of scientists. Introducing the aims and scope of the journal Evolutionary Ecology <span id="id41">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id123" title="M L Rosenzweig. No Title. Evol. Ecol., 1:1–3, 1987.">Rosenzweig, 1987</a>]</span> says,</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p><em>…some of our articles will examine the evolution of natural ecosystems. Others will stress how the external environment, biotic or abiotic, influences the course of evolution. Finally, there will be some that study how the environment actually molds the evolutionary mechanisms themselves.</em></p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Among these, the most common theme was the role of the abiotic and biotic milieu in guiding evolution, well expressed in Hutchinson’s <span id="id42">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id111" title="G Evelyn Hutchinson. The ecological theater and the evolutionary play. Yale University Press, New Haven, 1965.">Hutchinson, 1965</a>]</span>metaphor of “<em>The ecological theater and the evolutionary play”.</em> This focus on ecology as a background for evolutionary processes continues to be a dominant theme in evolutionary ecology (see below)<a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id203" id="id43" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>7<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a>.</p>
<p>As always, there was a difference in approach between ecologists and evolutionary biologists towards the synthesis. Whereas ecologists focused on evolution with respect to population dynamics, interspecific interactions and environmental aspects external to focal populations (e.g., heterogeneity of the biotic and abiotic habitat), ecologically oriented evolutionary geneticists such as Lewontin and Ford made detailed investigations of genetic variation in nature with a more population genetics approach. The term “Ecological Genetics” was coined by Ford in 1964, a field which in his words, <em>“…deals with the adjustments and adaptations of wild populations to their environment”</em> <span id="id44">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id194" title="E B Ford. Ecological Genetics. Chapman &amp; Hall, London, 1964.">Ford, 1964</a>]</span>. This program was bolstered by further development of population genetics theory on evolution in spatially heterogeneous environments, that had been initially formalized by Wright, Fisher and Haldane <span id="id45">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id197" title="William B Provine. The origins of theoretical population genetics.

<p>A significant development during this period, which had a huge impact on the evolutionary ecology synthesis, was the development of quantitative genetics theory <span id="id47">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id110" title="D S Falconer. Introduction to quantitative genetics. Ronald Press Co, Burnt Mill, Harlow, Essex, England, 1960.">Falconer, 1960</a>]</span>. Based on Fisher’s <span id="id48">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id160" title="Ronald A Fisher. The genetical theory of natural selection. Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1930.">Fisher, 1930</a>]</span> initial work and the ideas of the biometrician school of genetics <span id="id49">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id197" title="William B Provine. The origins of theoretical population genetics. University of Chicago Press, Chicago, 2001.">Provine, 2001</a>]</span>, this involved modeling evolution of quantitative, polygenic traits without explicit description of the underlying genetics, by using statistical descriptors (e.g., mean &amp; variance) of trait values. This approach was extremely useful from the viewpoint of empirical work, as it generated predictions about expected changes in continuously distributed trait values and indirect measurements of the strength of selection and fitness components from field data. Quantitative genetics therefore quickly became an integral component of ecological genetics. In a way, quantitative genetics was the ideal middle ground between population genetics and population ecology, as it involved a simplification of certain genetic as well as ecological complexities, yet addressing realistic scenarios. For example, consider a trait value <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\theta\)</span>, which is continuously distributed in a population as a Gaussian function <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">p(θ)</span></code>(i.e, the trait values are assumed to be normally distributed). Assume that there is no gene flow or mutation affecting the character, nor linkage disequilibrium <span id="id50">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id109" title="Montogemery Slatkin. Ecological Character Displacement. Ecology, 61(1):163, February 1980.">Slatkin, 1980</a>]</span>. As before, Let <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(w(\theta)\)</span> be the absolute fitness of an individual with trait <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\theta\)</span>. Various selection models can be used to generate values of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(w(θ)\)</span> (see below). Assuming that the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(w(\theta)\)</span> functions are given, the change in mean and variance of the trait values are respectively,</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[
\overline{z}(t+1) 
  = \frac{\sigma^{2}}{\sigma^{2} + \sigma_{e}^{2}}
    \int \theta  p(\theta) w(\theta) \frac{d\theta}{ \overline{W} }

<p>and</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">

<p>However, along with this upsurge of exchange between ecology and evolutionary biology from the 1950’s onwards, other issues within the two disciplines increasingly claimed attention, contributing further to the overall divergence of the two. Evolutionary biologists on one hand, enthused by advances in molecular biology were increasingly caught up in the gene-centered view of life, which was essentially reductionist <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Sarkar1998</span></code>. Apart from the different ways, as mentioned above, in which ecological realism was brought in by population geneticists into their models, a large body of biologists delved deeper into genetic models of selection and evolution, ignoring many aspects of genotype environment relationships. This reductionism has been lamented as being one of the causes of disunity between population biology and population genetics <span id="id60">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id100" title="Francisco Jose Ayala and Theodosius Grigorievich Dobzhansky.

<p>In ecology on the other hand, debates raged over the nature of community assembly, measures of stability in biological systems, the relative role of extrinsic vs. intrinsic factors driving ecological dynamics, the relationship between species diversity and community stability, the role of history in ecological patterns, and importance of processes at different spatial scales in determining diversity. Along the way, ecological sub-disciplines multiplied, with the addition of fields such as metapopulation ecology, metacommunity ecology, spatial ecology and landscape ecology. Unlike in evolutionary biology, a large rift also developed between theory and empirical work, with field biologists finding it tough going to glean testable predictions from complex, mechanistic models often inspired by physics, raising deep philosophical concerns about the role of theory in ecology and the place of ecology in biology <span id="id61">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id151">Kareiva <em>et al.</em>, 1989</a>, <a class="reference internal" href="#id130" title="Sharon E Kingsland.

Sex and death: an introduction to philosophy of biology. University of Chicago Press, Chicago, Ill, 1999.">Sterelny and Griffiths, 1999</a>]</span>. Field ecology became increasingly preoccupied with conducting detailed characterizations of ecological patterns at various levels of complexity ranging from individuals to ecosystems. The hope was that cataloging patterns and processes would somehow reveal general principles. This was the period when global patterns such as “Rapoport’s rule” <span id="id62">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id154" title="K J Gaston, T M Blackburn, and J I Spicer. Rapoport's rule: time for an epitaph? Trends Ecol.

Bergmann's rule and body size in mammals. Am. Nat., 161(5):821–825, 2003.">Freckleton <em>et al.</em>, 2003</a>]</span> were described. A formidable array of statistical techniques were also developed during this period to allow a mechanistic characterization of organism environment interrelationships. Evolutionary ecology took somewhat of a back-seat in these pursuits; especially because apart from a few exceptions, most of the focal biological systems for empirical work were vertebrates, where the role of evolution was considered insignificant at ecological time scales. Instead, complexity of the systems being studied commanded almost complete attention.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, in the meantime the unification of population genetics and population biology continued by a small group of biologists. From the 1980’s onwards in particular, the effort came closer to achieving a more seamless union due to the use of increasingly sophisticated mathematical treatment and careful empirical testing with new model systems by a new breed of biologists who dwelt comfortably in both ecological and evolutionary hemispheres. In particular, the convergence of multilocus population genetic and quantitative genetic models (Burger 2000)(<a class="reference external" href="https://paperpile.com/c/lwDPbc/fycI">https://paperpile.com/c/lwDPbc/fycI</a>) allowed greater ecological flexibility as well as genetic reality to evolutionary ecology modeling (Michael Doebeli 1996b, 1996a)(<a class="reference external" href="https://paperpile.com/c/lwDPbc/Abha+dbVj">https://paperpile.com/c/lwDPbc/Abha+dbVj</a>). In the process, these efforts diversified into various distinct approaches, which will be considered in the following section.</p>

<h2>The marriage of ecology and evolutionary biology: the ups, the downs, and a taxonomy<a class="headerlink" href="#the-marriage-of-ecology-and-evolutionary-biology-the-ups-the-downs-and-a-taxonomy" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>We can now attempt a classification of contemporary approaches in evolutionary ecology, based on three themes that appear to have traditionally been at the core of dissent between ecology and evolutionary biology: the issue of time-scale, the role of demography, and the effect of environmental heterogeneity. We will discuss these before presenting the classification.</p>
<p>Of the three issues, “time-scale” is mainly a cultural issue, referring to the importance given to history in population biology. Although there is no definable boundary between micro- vs. macro- evolutionary, or ecological vs. evolutionary time scales, the question of relative importance of processes at different time scales have generated distinct disciplines and this issue has apparently been a key factor affecting the unification of ecology and evolutionary biology.</p>
<p>The other two criteria are conceptual. The issue of demography is closely tied to the concept of fitness, and the two can be discussed together. Richard Levins gave a succinct account of these conceptual issues more than forty years ago, during an early phase of the evolutionary ecology synthesis <span id="id64">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id124" title="Richard Levins. Evolution in changing environments. Monographs in Population Biology. Princeton University Press, Princeton, NJ, August 1968.">Levins, 1968</a>]</span>(p. 5):</p>

While the population geneticist’s models generally assume stable age distributions, fixed populations sizes, and constant environments in order to study the pattern of genetic heterogeneity in single species, the population ecologist considers genetically uniform populations in multispecies systems in a heterogeneous environment</em>.</p>

<h3>The issue of ecological vs. evolutionary time scales<a class="headerlink" href="#the-issue-of-ecological-vs-evolutionary-time-scales" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>As mentioned above, the early school of evolutionary thought was essentially gradualist, with a firm belief in the slow and steady progress of evolution over the geological time scale, a viewpoint that was prevalent till relatively recently <span id="id65">[]</span>. A competing view of punctuated equilibrium too exists, but this does not alter the argument that is being made here. The relevance of micro-evolutionary processes to observed macroevolutionary patterns, is still a contentious issue in evolutionary biology because of the observed opposition of trends at different time scales <span id="id66">[]</span>. As such, this issue does not affect the evolutionary ecology synthesis much because evolutionary biologists naturally emphasize lineage-dependent processes and incorporate them into microevolutionary studies in an ecological context. However, a related view in ecology, that ecological and evolutionary time scales are independent of each other, has had considerable influence on the importance given to evolutionary processes in ecology. Tied to this is the strong faith among many ecologists of the existence of adaptation and co-adaptation in natural populations and their persistence over long, geologically significant periods of time <span id="id67">[]</span>. For example Pimm <span id="id68">[]</span> discusses the stability and persistence of populations with respect to time scales ranging from centuries to millennia or more, invoking evolution only as a purely historical process. Similarly, Tokeshi <span id="id69">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id166" title="M Tokeshi. Species coexistence: ecological and evolutionary perspectives. Blackwell Science, Oxford, 1999.">Tokeshi, 1999</a>]</span> discusses evolution in community structure on purely geological time scales. These perspectives naturally cause omission of evolutionary thought from ecological research.</p>
<p>We have already mentioned above that a view of disjunct temporal processes is rooted in the tradition in biology to study a small set of vertebrate model systems <span id="id70">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id92" title="Xavier Bonnet, Richard Shine, and Olivier Lourdais. Taxonomic chauvinism. Trends Ecol. Evol., 17(1):1–3, January 2002.">Bonnet <em>et al.</em>, 2002</a>, <a class="reference internal" href="#id93" title="Samraat Pawar. Taxonomic chauvinism and the methodologically challenged. Bioscience, 53(9):861–864, 2003.">Pawar, 2003</a>]</span>. There is no denying that evolutionary history is an important factor to consider in ecology, and has been given due consideration. However, the role of microevolution in ecological patterns and processes has not been well evaluated till the two decade or so. In the last two decades or so, ecological geneticists and molecular ecologists have shown ample evidence for the existence of functional polymorphism and gene frequency shifts in nature. Not surprisingly, there is now an increasing awareness of the need to integrate macro- and microevolutionary processes in ecology at different scales of organization <span id="id71">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id155" title="J Cavender-Bares and A Wilczek. Integrating micro- and macroevolutionary processes in community ecology. Ecology, 84(3):592–597, 2003.">Cavender-Bares and Wilczek, 2003</a>]</span>. In addition, the use of microbial model systems in ecology has also allowed many ecological questions to be answered in an evolutionary context, often adding important insights relevant to other systems where such methods are impossible <span id="id72">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id161" title="Christine M Jessup, Rees Kassen, Samantha E Forde, Ben Kerr, Angus Buckling, Paul B Rainey, and Brendan J M Bohannan. Big questions, small worlds: microbial model systems in ecology. Trends Ecol. Evol., 19(4):189–197, April 2004.">Jessup <em>et al.</em>, 2004</a>]</span>. Perhaps ironically, the empirical insights from contemporary microbial work have come more than 60 years after Gause’s <span id="id73">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id145" title="G F Gause. Experimental analysis of vito volterra's mathematical theory of the struggle for existence. Science, 79(2036):16–17, January 1934.">Gause, 1934</a>]</span> ecological experiments with microorganisms, which too had a strong evolutionary context. No doubt advances in molecular biology techniques have a large part to play in this, but this also reflects the reticence of ecologists to deviate from established model biological systems.</p>
<p>The argument here of course, is not that research on elephants and tigers be completely abandoned in favor of laboratory cultures; it is a plea for a pluralism of empirical approach that will provide insights for finding avenues of escape from the theoretical cul-de-sac that ecologists often find themselves due to the inability to test crucial aspects of their models <span id="id74">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id151">Kareiva <em>et al.</em>, 1989</a>]</span>. Indeed, in the subsequent discussion on the empirical support for evolutionary ecology theory, there will be a striking preponderance of work on rapidly evolving model organisms such as bacteria and <em>Drosophila</em> that have provided new insights into questions that have traditionally challenged ecologists.</p>

<section id="demographic-considerations-and-measures-of-fitness">
<h3>Demographic considerations and measures of fitness<a class="headerlink" href="#demographic-considerations-and-measures-of-fitness" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>From a population biology perspective, many questions are raised by the treatment of demography and the closely tied concept of fitness in evolutionary biology. The issue of fitness in particular, is a controversial one even within evolutionary biology <span id="id75">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id196" title="A Ariew and R C C Lewontin. The confusions of fitness. Br. J. Philos. …, 55(2):347–363, 2004.">Ariew and Lewontin, 2004</a>, <a class="reference internal" href="#id95">Lewontin <em>et al.</em>, 2004</a>]</span>. For our purposes however, we will focus on three aspects of population genetics that have particularly troubled population ecologists. The first two of these are visible in the illustration of the traditional population genetics approach in the equations above. The problems are,</p>
<p>(i) population sizes are assumed to be infinite, which circumvents the complications of random birth-death processes in finite populations (called “ecological drift” or “demographic stochasticity”) <span id="id76">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id94" title="P A Abrams, Stephen P Hubbell, and C de Mazancourt. The unified neutral theory of biodiversity and biogeography. Nature, 412(5536):1772, 2001.">Abrams <em>et al.</em>, 2001</a>]</span>.
(ii) The Malthusian parameter <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(r\)</span> is converted into a fitness measure <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(s\)</span> by assuming fixed population size, which allows the convenience of reducing the parameters to just genotype proportions and relative fitnesses, and
(iii) When considering inter-specific interactions, the mean fitness (eqn. <code class="xref eq docutils literal notranslate"> </code>) of species’ population becomes an absolute measure, creating the need to develop a general algorithm for translating absolute fitnesses between populations. As will be emphasized below, the use of quantitative genetic models helped resolve the problem theoretically, but the practicability of measuring fitness components in the field remains a difficult issue.</p>
<p>Population geneticists dealt with the issue of infinite population size by introducing population size as a statistical parameter that affected the rate of random genetic drift– effective population size, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(N_e\)</span> <span id="id77">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id103" title="M Kimura. The Neutral Theory of Molecular Evolution. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 1983.">Kimura, 1983</a>]</span>. Although it was not an entirely satisfactory solution from a population biology perspective as it is only a phenomenological model of demographic stochasticity, it was acceptable in ecology because it could still be used to consider the evolutionary consequences of finite population size in terms of extinction probabilities <span id="id78">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id179" title="Graeme Caughley. Directions in Conservation Biology. J. Anim. Ecol., 63(2):215, April 1994.">Caughley, 1994</a>]</span>. The issue of fixed population sizes on the other hand, raised some crucial questions for population biologists. What happens when populations change in size as they inevitably do? Or when generations are not discrete, but overlapping? Or when population change is density dependent? Extensions of population genetics theory to address questions of population change and overlapping generations had been accomplished by the 1970’s, albeit with some issues still unresolved <span id="id79">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id105" title="Brian Charlesworth. Evolution in age-structured populations. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge Eng., 1980.">Charlesworth, 1980</a>, <a class="reference internal" href="#id95">Lewontin <em>et al.</em>, 2004</a>]</span>.</p>
<p>Evolution under density dependent population growth was first modeled by Kostitzin between 1935-40 <span id="id80">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id96">Christiansen <em>et al.</em>, 2004</a>]</span>, and Fisher <span id="id81">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id160" title="Ronald A Fisher. The genetical theory of natural selection. Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1930.">Fisher, 1930</a>]</span> by assuming weak selection, and fitnesses dependent upon density dependent death rates. Subsequently, MacArthur <span id="id82">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id163" title="R H Robert H Macarthur. Some generalized theorems of natural selection. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. …, 18(11):1893–1897, November 1962.">Macarthur, 1962</a>]</span> used a similar approach, but used the then familiar <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(r\)</span> &amp; <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(K\)</span> parameterization of the Pearl-Verhulst logistic growth equation of density dependent growth,</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[
    \dfrac{dN}{dt} = rN\left( 1-\frac{N}{K}\right)
\]</div>
<p>This general approach, which was developed further by others <span id="id83">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id96">Christiansen <em>et al.</em>, 2004</a>]</span> will be briefly illustrated here. Consider a haploid, asexual population with only two alleles 1 &amp; 2 at a single locus. Assuming that the population is under density dependent growth, the fitnesses can then be defined as (cf eqns 8-10),</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[
    w_{1} = 1 + r_{1}\Bigl(1 - \frac{N}{K}\Bigr)
    \quad \text{and} \quad
    w_{2} = 1 + r_{2}\Bigl(1 - \frac{N}{K}\Bigr)
\]</div>
<p>Frequency dependent selection and genotype-specific carrying capacities can now be included by extending these eqns to,</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[
    w_{1} = 1 + r_{1} \Bigl(1 - \frac{N_{1} + N_{2}}{K_{1}}\Bigr)
    \quad \text{and} \quad
    w_{2} = 1 + r_{2} \Bigl(1 - \frac{N_{1} + N_{2}}{K_{2}}\Bigr)
\]</div>
<p>which amounts to rephrasing the Lotka-Volterra equations (eqns. <code class="xref eq docutils literal notranslate"> </code>) for competition of two species to competition between two genotypes of one species, assuming the intra-specific competition parameters to be <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\alpha_{12} = α_{21} = 1\)</span>. Extensions of such models to overlapping generations under different single-population scenarios, and to coevolution of two or more species have provided many interesting insights, and contributed to the unification of population genetics and ecology <span id="id84">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id96">Christiansen <em>et al.</em>, 2004</a>]</span>. The first major result of this research, of course, was the development in the 1970’s of the ideas <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(r\)</span>-<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(K\)</span> selection and the role of the environment in shaping life history strategies <span id="id85">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id96">Christiansen <em>et al.</em>, 2004</a>, <a class="reference internal" href="#id149" title="Robert H MacArthur and Edward O Wilson.

Theory of Population Genetics and Evolutionary Ecology: an Introduction. Macmillan Publishing Co., Inc., New York, 1979.">Roughgarden, 1979</a>]</span>.</p>
<p>However, modeling fitnesses under frequency as well as density dependent growth in multiple populations does create the third problem mentioned above: that of absolute fitnesses. The interpretation of density dependent fitnesses becomes difficult in multi-species systems because mapping the effect of each populations absolute mean fitness on another population becomes context dependent because fitnesses are a function of the environment under this scheme (because they are tied to <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(K\)</span>), instead of being an inherent property of individuals’ genotype <span id="id86">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id196" title="A Ariew and R C C Lewontin. The confusions of fitness. Br. J. Philos. …, 55(2):347–363, 2004.">Ariew and Lewontin, 2004</a>, <a class="reference internal" href="#id95">Lewontin <em>et al.</em>, 2004</a>]</span>. This makes it difficult to develop a framework for making general predictions about the evolutionary outcomes of species interactions without taking the situation-specific environment-phenotype-genotype map into consideration. For example, if we want to extend eqns. <code class="xref eq docutils literal notranslate"> </code> to two haploid asexual species <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A\)</span> &amp; <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(B\)</span>, each experiencing intra- and inter-specific density as well as frequency dependent selection, we could begin with, assuming one locus and two alleles, and using the Lotka-Volterra scheme,</p>

<p>In each generation, the population growth is a function of the mean fitness![][image43]of the population in the previous generation, made up of the relative contributions of the two genotypes. For example, if allele A is fixed in the species <em>A</em>, its population will grow at a density dependent growth determined by the <em>r</em> and <em>K</em> values of the genotype 1<em>A</em> and its interaction with genotypes of species <em>B</em>. Eqns.(14-19) illustrate the difficulty with measuring fitness in such situations. In this model, one would have to keep track of no less than 10 parameters to evaluate the evolutionary outcome of interaction between just two species! And this is assuming that <em>α</em> is a reasonable representation of both direct and indirect interactions in nature. Computer simulations and mathematical analyses (with some reparameterization) of these models do yield insights, but measuring all the components of fitness in such a situation to be an almost impossible task in reality, let alone defining a more general scheme for translating absolute fitnesses between species.</p>
<p>The problem is considerably simplified by using a quantitative genetics framework (see eqns. (9-10) above). For example, for the two competing species in the above example, the fitness functions from eqns (14 &amp; 16) could be easily modified to feed into eqns. (9 &amp; 10), thus creating a quantitative map between fitnesses of the two populations generated by frequency- and density-dependent interactions within and between species. However, the empirical problem of measuring all components of fitness remains a difficult problem. On the whole then, the manner in which fitnesses are dealt with will be an important criterion for the classification presented below. It will become apparent that certain model systems that have been used in recent empirical work are relatively amenable to estimation of fitness components. This has gone a long way in testing some theoretical predictions.</p>
<p>It should also be noted that in addition to examining the role of demography in evolution, it is possible to flip the question over, and focus on the effects of evolution on population dynamics. Such work has also emerged in recent years and is an area of active theoretical development and empirical research, adding yet another facet to evolutionary ecology.</p>

<section id="the-role-of-environmental-heterogeneity">
<h3>The role of environmental heterogeneity<a class="headerlink" href="#the-role-of-environmental-heterogeneity" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>The ‘problem’ of complex population behavior and the role of “external” vs. “internal” factors play an important role in ecology (Hastings et al. 1993)(<a class="reference external" href="https://paperpile.com/c/lwDPbc/GV43">https://paperpile.com/c/lwDPbc/GV43</a>). In search for answers to such questions, ecologists have expended considerable effort over the last century for a detailed characterization of heterogeneity in nature. Areas such as landscape and spatial ecology have steadily built a realistic characterization of heterogeneity in nature, and to many biologists, ecology is synonymous with environmental characteristics; the ecology of a species is at least as likely to connote the organism’s environment as its inherent properties, such as life history characteristics. As was pointed out above, the field of ecological genetics has developed around this view of ecology.<br />
The incorporation of environmental heterogeneity into a unified evolutionary ecology framework is far from complete though. This is one area where the flow of information must largely be from the direction of ecology (in its environmental avatar) towards evolution. As Levins (Levins 2004)(<a class="reference external" href="https://paperpile.com/c/lwDPbc/Uyrg">https://paperpile.com/c/lwDPbc/Uyrg</a>) points out, “ ‘<em>There has always been a much finer sophistication of our understanding of genetic variation than of the environment,</em>’ ‘<em>…a successful study of evolution requires the recognition of the complexity, not just of the genotype, but also of the environment and of the whole organism in its development and its physiological flux’</em> “. This is of course, a reiteration of the argument made above about the effect of genetic reductionism on the conceptual unification of population genetics and population biology. Practitioners of ecological genetics do indeed often pay just lip service to environmental heterogeneity, using a set approach of employing statistical tools to fit observed genetic variation to predictions of traditional population genetics models, most of which have tenuous connections with ecological reality. Statistically reasonable fits may be observed, but the results do not reveal whether the model being tested describes the real mechanisms for the maintenance of genetic variation. Although this is a general concern in all scientific disciplines, it is also a function of how much of the universe of possibilities has been explored while formulating theories.<br />
In the quest for a formal description of all the nuances of environment complexity, ecologists have been no laggards; the mathematical structure of many aspects of the environment in which evolution can potentially operate has been well characterized in both time (Vasseur and Yodzis 2004)(<a class="reference external" href="https://paperpile.com/c/lwDPbc/dKQx">https://paperpile.com/c/lwDPbc/dKQx</a>) and space (Keitt et al. 2002)(<a class="reference external" href="https://paperpile.com/c/lwDPbc/3b7Q">https://paperpile.com/c/lwDPbc/3b7Q</a>). For example, consider Figure 1, which shows an empirical observation of temporal environmental pattern: seasonal variation in temperature across latitudes. It is well known that the amplitude of seasonal cycles as well as random environmental noise increases away from the latitudes (Vasseur and Yodzis 2004)(<a class="reference external" href="https://paperpile.com/c/lwDPbc/dKQx">https://paperpile.com/c/lwDPbc/dKQx</a>).</p>
<p>Fig. 1. Variation in temperature across months over 11 years for four sites spanning 400 of latitude, from New Zealand (46.70S), to Papua New Guinea (6.730S). All sites are from a similar altitude (0–20 m above sea level (S. S. Pawar 2005)(<a class="reference external" href="https://paperpile.com/c/lwDPbc/BCIv">https://paperpile.com/c/lwDPbc/BCIv</a>). Note that the fluctuations increase away from the equator.</p>
<p>![][image44]</p>
<p>This observation is easily translated into a model of fluctuating selection (Bürger and Gimelfarb 2002)(<a class="reference external" href="https://paperpile.com/c/lwDPbc/3fia">https://paperpile.com/c/lwDPbc/3fia</a>). Consider a selectively optimum trait value <em>θ</em>, such as the one introduced in eqn.(9). Assume that the position of the optimum fluctuates cyclically about the midpoint of the range of trait values (<em>θo</em>), with a scaled random perturbation around it. This can be modeled by assuming that at time <em>t</em> the optimum <em>θt</em> is drawn from a normal distribution with mean</p>
<p>![][image45]										      (20)</p>
<p>where <em>A</em> is the amplitude and <em>L</em> the length of the selection cycle relative to the organism’s generation time. The perturbations have a standard deviation![][image46], where <em>d</em> is a measure of the magnitude of stochasticity. If <em>d</em>=0, there is purely cyclical selection; if, in addition, <em>A</em>=0, there is pure Gaussian stabilizing selection. Figure 2 shows the temporal pattern of cyclical selection generated from this model with arbitrary parameter values. This matches the empirical pattern in Figure 1 quite well.</p>
<p>Fig. 2. Cyclical selection with random fluctuations over 100 generations, based on the model in eqn. (20).</p>
<p>![untitled][image47]</p>
<p>This idea can then be further developed to consider the effect of such environmental grain on evolution as well as persistence of populations. After the initial beginning in the 1960’s of work on the effect of fluctuating environments on adaptation and persistence of populations, the role of periodic instead of completely random fluctuations, partly motivated by empirical patterns like the one in Figure 1, increasingly drew attention over the last decade or so, yielding new insights (Kirzhner, Korol, and Nevo 1998; Wichmann et al. 2003; Bürger and Gimelfarb 2002; Lande and Shannon 1996)(<a class="reference external" href="https://paperpile.com/c/lwDPbc/032V+9RCS+3fia+fzdV">https://paperpile.com/c/lwDPbc/032V+9RCS+3fia+fzdV</a>). Detailed examination of such empirical patterns of environmental heterogeneity can also help resolve questions about the likelihood of seeing certain evolutionary processes in nature. For example, Gillespie (J. H. Gillespie, Singh, and Uyenoyama 2004)(<a class="reference external" href="https://paperpile.com/c/lwDPbc/Nb5C">https://paperpile.com/c/lwDPbc/Nb5C</a>) long argued that widely accepted population genetic models of adaptive evolution in DNA sequences need to be reevaluated in light of the fact that certain patterns of fluctuating selection can generate patterns of polymorphism akin to those from models of neutral evolution, a claim that remains largely untested. The evolutionary ecology synthesis will definitely benefit from the use of environmental information; the extent to which this has been achieved is considered in the classification that follows.</p>

<p>Each of these research programs is now discussed with reference to the nature of scientific approach, the conceptual issues it addresses, its theory and supporting empirical data. Together, these disciplines comprise a number of research topics and a huge body of literature. This discussion below does not claim to be an exhaustive survey of all topics. Within each research program however, poorly explored avenues of interesting research are also mentioned.</p>
<p><strong>I. Paleo-population biology</strong><br />
One solution towards fusing evolution and ecology is to incorporate historical processes by reconstructing the evolutionary history and paleo-ecology of populations and drawing inferences about contemporary properties of organisms. Two distinct approaches are currently being used:</p>
<p><strong>(a) <em>Non-demographic schema</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Approach</strong>.This program of research is an outcome of the above-mentioned ‘historical’ viewpoint mentioned that has been so prevalent in ecology. This program was invigorated in the 1990’s by the introduction of phylogenetic techniques, thus allowing a more reliable reconstruction of evolutionary history (Eggleton and Vane-Wright 1994; Losos 1996)(<a class="reference external" href="https://paperpile.com/c/lwDPbc/6vwA+rB1C">https://paperpile.com/c/lwDPbc/6vwA+rB1C</a>). This method is non-demographic in the sense that population size considerations rarely enter the analyses, either in the historical reconstructions, or in the study of contemporary adaptations. The concepts of fitness used here are absolute and qualitative, with the outcome of interactions between populations described in terms of the apparent level of fitness in populations.</p>
<p><strong>Research themes:</strong> <em>theory and empirical results</em>. This approach is strongly retrospective, generally involving verbal extensions of prospective evolutionary ecology models such as those of character displacement and the mapping of traits onto phylogenies (Eggleton and Vane-Wright 1994; Losos 1996)(<a class="reference external" href="https://paperpile.com/c/lwDPbc/6vwA+rB1C">https://paperpile.com/c/lwDPbc/6vwA+rB1C</a>). Some prominent themes for research are adaptive radiation into ecological niches (Schluter 2000; Losos and Miles 2002)(<a class="reference external" href="https://paperpile.com/c/lwDPbc/H1J6+uLfC">https://paperpile.com/c/lwDPbc/H1J6+uLfC</a>), Outcome of species interactions (e.g., evolutionary character displacement; (Radtkey, Fallon, and Case 1997)(<a class="reference external" href="https://paperpile.com/c/lwDPbc/Qrll">https://paperpile.com/c/lwDPbc/Qrll</a>), and the manner of community assembly (R. Gillespie 2004)(<a class="reference external" href="https://paperpile.com/c/lwDPbc/GUZ0">https://paperpile.com/c/lwDPbc/GUZ0</a>). The insights from these lines of work have served to greatly clarify the role of evolution in structuring communities and molding species interactions. For example, Gillespie (R. Gillespie 2004)(<a class="reference external" href="https://paperpile.com/c/lwDPbc/GUZ0">https://paperpile.com/c/lwDPbc/GUZ0</a>) has shown that convergent evolution into similar niches has an important role in community assembly, shedding light on the long unresolved debate in community ecology about the manner of community assembly, and the existence of “assembly rules” (Weiher and Keddy 1995)(<a class="reference external" href="https://paperpile.com/c/lwDPbc/3lUy">https://paperpile.com/c/lwDPbc/3lUy</a>). On the flipside, such studies contribute a lot towards clarifying the role of ecology in speciation, a burgeoning topic in evolutionary biology (Coyne and Orr 2004)(<a class="reference external" href="https://paperpile.com/c/lwDPbc/fVZt">https://paperpile.com/c/lwDPbc/fVZt</a>).</p>
<p><strong>(b) <em>Demographic schema</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Approach</strong>*.*This relatively new area involves the inference of “historical demography” combined with analyses of properties of extant populations. This has been made possible by recent attempts to bring the coalescence theory (Kingman 2000)(<a class="reference external" href="https://paperpile.com/c/lwDPbc/PMBy">https://paperpile.com/c/lwDPbc/PMBy</a>) of population genetics and phylogenetics closer together to evaluate the interrelationships between micro- and macroevolution (Wakeley, Singh, and Uyenoyama 2004)(<a class="reference external" href="https://paperpile.com/c/lwDPbc/yxzS">https://paperpile.com/c/lwDPbc/yxzS</a>). This approach also opens up the possibility of explicitly including historical population structure in analyses of current populations, a topic that has hitherto been difficult to deal with except by verbal arguments in ecology as well as evolutionary biology. As paleo-population structure is inferred purely from nucleotide polymorphism data, this approach obviously cannot infer past environmental heterogeneity explicitly unless paleo-ecological events can be dated and implicated using molecular clock approaches. Fitnesses obviously do not even enter the picture as far as the historical component is concerned. The analyses of extant populations can of course include both, fitness measures and consideration of environmental heterogeneity.</p>
<p><strong>Research themes:</strong> <em>theory and empirical results.</em> Obviously, the past can impinge upon almost every feature of extant organisms. The themes that will be developed in this area will only be bound by the limits of the collaboration between paleobiology, phylogenetics, coalescent theory, and ecology. These are widely separated disciplines, and a coherent theory will probably take a while to develop. Research in this area could include, but need not be restricted to, all of the themes of the approaches under the non-demographic schema mentioned above. For example, recently, Flanagan et al (Flanagan et al. 2004)(<a class="reference external" href="https://paperpile.com/c/lwDPbc/GW6y">https://paperpile.com/c/lwDPbc/GW6y</a>) used such an approach to clarify the role of historical demography in the coevolution of two Müllerian comimetic butterfly species. The potential of this area of research is huge; all the questions asked in the non-demographic schema above can be better addressed by such analyses.</p>
<p><strong>II. Microevolutionary ecology</strong></p>
<p>This is a much larger area of research than paleo-population biology, because prospective study of extant populations is the predominant approach in population biology. This area involves the consideration of microevolutionary changes in generating ecological patterns and processes, as well as the effect of the environment on observable evolution. Two broad categories of approach can be identified here:</p>
<p><strong>(a) <em>Non-demographic schema</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Approach</strong>*.*This program involves the extension of population genetics (including quantitative genetics) to realistic ecological (in the sense of the adaptive environment) scenarios, for a detailed examination of populations’ characteristics in relation to the environment. In keeping with the population genetic framework, population size only appears if at all, as <em>Ne</em>, and fitnesses are relative, or if multiple species are considered, may be juxtaposed by analyses of mean population fitnesses (generally using quantitative genetics). The most common aspect of ecological heterogeneity is spatial, while temporal variation in the abiotic environment is increasingly being studied, with rare examples of a combination of the two (Frank and Slatkin 1990)(<a class="reference external" href="https://paperpile.com/c/lwDPbc/YH5u">https://paperpile.com/c/lwDPbc/YH5u</a>).</p>
<p><strong>Research themes:</strong> <em>theory and empirical results.</em> Most studies in ecological genetics and molecular ecology use this approach to establish the relationships between genetic variation in nature and ecological heterogeneity (Brian Charlesworth, Charlesworth, and Barton 2003)(<a class="reference external" href="https://paperpile.com/c/lwDPbc/H4zB">https://paperpile.com/c/lwDPbc/H4zB</a>), wherein the focal population’s environs can be both biotic (e.g., herbivore-plant interactions), as well as abiotic (DeSalle and Schierwater 1998; Beebee and Rowe 2004; Conner and Hartl 2004)(<a class="reference external" href="https://paperpile.com/c/lwDPbc/S0h5+1SH7+fazZ">https://paperpile.com/c/lwDPbc/S0h5+1SH7+fazZ</a>). Other themes are evolution in temporally fluctuating environments (A. Sasaki and Ellner 1997; Ellner 1996; Akira Sasaki and Ellner 1995; J. H. Gillespie 1991)(<a class="reference external" href="https://paperpile.com/c/lwDPbc/gSfW+mNWb+aTAq+xa9v">https://paperpile.com/c/lwDPbc/gSfW+mNWb+aTAq+xa9v</a>), evolution in spatio-temporally fluctuating environments (Frank and Slatkin 1990)(<a class="reference external" href="https://paperpile.com/c/lwDPbc/YH5u">https://paperpile.com/c/lwDPbc/YH5u</a>), evolutionary outcome of species interactions with such as competition and predation with or without interactions with the environment (P. a. Abrams 2000; M. Slatkin and Maynard Smith 1979; Montogemery Slatkin 1980; Agrawal 2003)(<a class="reference external" href="https://paperpile.com/c/lwDPbc/uGXo+o46W+O2ah+DBMh">https://paperpile.com/c/lwDPbc/uGXo+o46W+O2ah+DBMh</a>). A large empirical area corresponding to the last is the whole area of evolutionary ecology of plant-animal interactions, which involves the study of coevolution between populations, which does not generally consider demography explicitly, defines fitnesses largely qualitatively in terms of apparent adaptations of populations, with or without consideration of abiotic environment (Wöhrmann and Loeschcke 1984; Price and Schluter 1991; Emlen 1973; Beattie 1985; Drake 1968; Karlin and Nevo 1976; Poulin 1998)(<a class="reference external" href="https://paperpile.com/c/lwDPbc/VruJ+4cMl+E8U4+kCz4+zzc1+xIOL+j3Gh">https://paperpile.com/c/lwDPbc/VruJ+4cMl+E8U4+kCz4+zzc1+xIOL+j3Gh</a>). An important area that has recently come to the fore is the study of the role of the environment in determining evolutionary rates at the molecular level (S. S. Pawar 2005)(<a class="reference external" href="https://paperpile.com/c/lwDPbc/BCIv">https://paperpile.com/c/lwDPbc/BCIv</a>). This has raised some interesting new questions about the evolutionary mechanisms behind latitudinal diversity gradients, an issue that has traditionally been an ecological topic. In addition, work with microorganisms has also provided valuable data for evolution in temporally fluctuating (Bell and Reboud 1997; Reboud and Bell 1997; Scheiner and Yampolsky 1998; Kassen and Bell 1998)(<a class="reference external" href="https://paperpile.com/c/lwDPbc/0eyC+P2GH+HqQK+XFKD">https://paperpile.com/c/lwDPbc/0eyC+P2GH+HqQK+XFKD</a>) as well as spatially variable (Travisano, Vasi, and Lenski 1995)(<a class="reference external" href="https://paperpile.com/c/lwDPbc/Sc6a">https://paperpile.com/c/lwDPbc/Sc6a</a>) environments.</p>
<p><strong>(b) Indirect-demographic schema</strong></p>
<p><strong>Approach</strong>*.* This area involves the study of populations in nature using ecological genetic techniques, and inferring demographic characteristics (generally, effective population size, <em>Ne</em>) indirectly, by using population genetics theory. Fitness measures are absolute, and generally qualitative. Ecological heterogeneity, if considered, is generally spatial.</p>
<p><strong>Research themes:</strong> <em>theory and empirical results–</em><br />
The theoretical basis for this line of research is traditional population genetics theory, where genetic variation is used to estimate demographic characteristics such as N<em>e</em> and population structure (Hedrick 1984)(<a class="reference external" href="https://paperpile.com/c/lwDPbc/HqLP">https://paperpile.com/c/lwDPbc/HqLP</a>). As most inferences about population characteristics are indirectly inferred, this area has a restricted range of themes, and will probably be absorbed into one or more of the other categories. Most results in this area have yielded insights into the impact of natural or anthropogenic environment variation on characteristics of single populations  (Crawford, Macleod, and Mitchell 2003; Woolfit 2003)(<a class="reference external" href="https://paperpile.com/c/lwDPbc/tPSr+D6TV">https://paperpile.com/c/lwDPbc/tPSr+D6TV</a>).</p>
<p><strong>(b) Direct-Demographic schema</strong></p>
<p><strong>Approach</strong>. This area of research is a rapidly growing area, and includes a range of distinct research themes that have their origins in ecology or evolutionary biology. All these involve explicit consideration of demography. The most complex topics involve a three-way interaction between the environment, demographic dynamics, and evolution, perhaps capturing the essence of what has been visualized to be a unified population biology (Travis et al. 1989; Levins 2004; Lewontin et al. 2004)(<a class="reference external" href="https://paperpile.com/c/lwDPbc/bZbA+Uyrg+fPH1">https://paperpile.com/c/lwDPbc/bZbA+Uyrg+fPH1</a>). The characterization of fitness in this diverse research area is naturally variable. To a great extent, the problems that have been mentioned above with the measurement of fitness components is perhaps the most relevant to demographically-oriented objectives of these studies.</p>
<p><strong>Research themes:</strong> <em>theory and empirical results.</em> The theory that underlies this area has been covered in parts in the previous sections, and involves demographically explicit models that combine population genetics (including quantitative genetics) with different levels of ecological heterogeneity. The themes of research are wide ranging (Brussard and Allard 1978)(<a class="reference external" href="https://paperpile.com/c/lwDPbc/okQu">https://paperpile.com/c/lwDPbc/okQu</a>) include the effects of evolutionary change on demographic characteristics and vice versa (Michael Doebeli and Koella 1994, 1995; Michael Doebeli 1996b; M. Doebeli 1996; Michael Doebeli 1996a)(<a class="reference external" href="https://paperpile.com/c/lwDPbc/2IfO+n8sU+Abha+L8fS+dbVj">https://paperpile.com/c/lwDPbc/2IfO+n8sU+Abha+L8fS+dbVj</a>), evolutionary changes in communities (Norberg et al. 2001)(<a class="reference external" href="https://paperpile.com/c/lwDPbc/t6g5">https://paperpile.com/c/lwDPbc/t6g5</a>), evolution of population stability, evolution of life history traits (B. Charlesworth 1993; Brian Charlesworth 1980; Reznick, Bryant, and Bashey 2002; Mueller and Joshi 2000; Levins 1968; A. D. Bradshaw and Shorrocks 1984; Norberg et al. 2001; M. Doebeli and de Jong 1999; Michael Doebeli 1996b; Michael Doebeli and Koella 1995)(<a class="reference external" href="https://paperpile.com/c/lwDPbc/a4Tw+VakU+09ni+69mL+WlSX+QWRf+t6g5+h1PE+Abha+n8sU">https://paperpile.com/c/lwDPbc/a4Tw+VakU+09ni+69mL+WlSX+QWRf+t6g5+h1PE+Abha+n8sU</a>), and evolution in fluctuating environments (Reznick, Bryant, and Bashey 2002; Mueller and Joshi 2000)(<a class="reference external" href="https://paperpile.com/c/lwDPbc/09ni+69mL">https://paperpile.com/c/lwDPbc/09ni+69mL</a>).<br />
This area has had a long history of disjunction between theory and the empirical work, partly because many of the predictions of microevolutionary ecology models cannot be tested easily either because fitness components are difficult to measure, or the rate of evolution in the model organisms is too slow to be observed in reasonable time scales. However, the inclusion of new model systems, which was mentioned in section 3.1 above, has had a big impact on this situation. For example, work with <em>Drosophila</em> and <em>Poecilia (Reznick, Bryant, and Bashey 2002; Mueller and Joshi 2000)(<a class="reference external" href="https://paperpile.com/c/lwDPbc/09ni+69mL">https://paperpile.com/c/lwDPbc/09ni+69mL</a>)</em> has produced the first concrete support for some of the predictions of theory on evolution of life history traits. Work with microorganisms too has provided strong evidence for the role of evolution in molding population dynamics (Yoshida et al. 2003; Fussmann, Ellner, and Hairston 2003)(<a class="reference external" href="https://paperpile.com/c/lwDPbc/UP82+gqas">https://paperpile.com/c/lwDPbc/UP82+gqas</a>). This has important implications for the one of the longest-lived problems in ecology of pinpointing the factors driving population cycles in microtine rodents and their predators, for which evolutionary hypotheses had been proposed before, but had received little attention by ecologists (Peter Turchin 2003; Chitty 1996)(<a class="reference external" href="https://paperpile.com/c/lwDPbc/VtwM+P2dw">https://paperpile.com/c/lwDPbc/VtwM+P2dw</a>). A number of equally valuable insights on other ecological questions from work with other microorganisms (Jessup et al. 2004)(<a class="reference external" href="https://paperpile.com/c/lwDPbc/8fxM">https://paperpile.com/c/lwDPbc/8fxM</a>).</p>

<h3>Has The Marriage Come Of Age?<a class="headerlink" href="#has-the-marriage-come-of-age" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>So what has been the outcome of this intricate branching of evolutionary ecology? In a recent paper, Lewontin and Levins, two key figures in the program for a unified population biology, provide an assessment, which ranges from being cautiously optimistic to rather dyspeptic <a class="reference external" href="https://paperpile.com/c/lwDPbc/fPH1">(Lewontin et al. 2004)</a>. After discussing a range of topics that are at the heart of the synthesis, Levins laments that “This program for an integrated population biology remains an aspiration that has not been carried out in practice. Instead, we see a gross imbalance among these components and a continued separation of the disciplines”. This is definitely true to the extent that the mainstream of ecology and evolutionary biology do indeed proceed happily along a divergent (or parallel) path, as was observed at the beginning of this paper. However, I am inclined to be more optimistic that Levins is.<br />
The taxonomy of a unified population biology that has been presented here is no doubt temporary, but serves the purpose of demonstrating the impressive range of topics that studies undertaking an evolutionary approach have managed to cover, both in theory, and empirical work. One factor that Lewontin and Levins do not seem to have considered, is the crucial role that the quantitative genetics models have played in providing at the very least, heuristic insights into the role of ecology in evolution, and vice versa. Moreover, there is ample evidence for the bi-directional flow of contribution, which indicates a greater balance, perhaps not yet fully appreciated, in the nature of the unification. There is no doubt that the marriage has not yet come of age. However, its rapid progress in the last two decades or so, bode good tidings for the not too distant near future.</p>

<h3>On the Dullness of Ecology<a class="headerlink" href="#on-the-dullness-of-ecology" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>It was pointed out at the beginning that the philosophy of biology appears to suffer from a considerable disinterest in ecology, especially in comparison to evolutionary biology <a class="reference external" href="https://paperpile.com/c/lwDPbc/PICF+MDgF+Tpjb+JR1s">(Grene and Depew 2004; Sober 1993a; Hull and Ruse 1998; Hull 1974)</a>. To some extent, this is understandable, as no other work in history has shaken the teleological foundations of human culture, as Darwin’s radical theory <a class="reference external" href="https://paperpile.com/c/lwDPbc/JR1s+MDgF">(Hull 1974; Sober 1993a)</a>. Considering the fact that the role of teleology in evolutionary biology have been an important topic of discussion <a class="reference external" href="https://paperpile.com/c/lwDPbc/rVc1">(Sterelny and Griffiths 1999)</a><a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id206" id="id88" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>10<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a>, this disinterest in the philosophy of ecology is surprising because there has been a widespread belief in ecology of the existence of optimal strategies, stability and persistence, the roots and implications of which are worth contemplating about. In this context, Hull <a class="reference external" href="https://paperpile.com/c/lwDPbc/JR1s">(Hull 1974)</a> has a definition of teleology in the biological context that applies well to ecology: “<em>prevalence of preferred states, closed feedback loops and programs, and the origin of such systems by means of selection processes</em>.” On the other hand, apart from the issue of teleology, evolutionary biology also offers a much more coherent theoretical structure compared to ecology, and has thrown up its share of interesting topics ranging from the role of biological determinism, to issues such as the meaning of species, units of evolution and selection, and so on <a class="reference external" href="https://paperpile.com/c/lwDPbc/PICF+rVc1">(Grene and Depew 2004; Sterelny and Griffiths 1999)</a>.<br />
This paper offers another, perhaps more fundamental reason for a reconsideration of the dullness of ecology. The question of the existence of laws in biology of has been a topic that has troubled biologists and philosophers for a while, and still provides ample fodder for rumination <a class="reference external" href="https://paperpile.com/c/lwDPbc/FE1J+WSwP+tvrS+KQ8r+wyg0">(Bergandi and Blandin 1998; Kingsland 1985; Ginzburg and Colyvan 2004; Yrjö Haila and Taylor 2001; Cooper 2003)</a>. And if philosophers are interested in the laws of biology, where better to look at the rather discordant structure of ecology? Opinions about the validity of the theoretical foundations of ecology and the presence of laws vary widely, ranging from agreement about the presence of general principles at one end <a class="reference external" href="https://paperpile.com/c/lwDPbc/SoZk+ugaQ">(Berryman and Uni 2003; P. Turchin 2002)</a>, to the declaration of the theoretical redundancy of ecology to the advancement of biology on the other <a class="reference external" href="https://paperpile.com/c/lwDPbc/KQ8r">(Yrjö Haila and Taylor 2001)</a>. Writing about the relationship between ecology and evolution, Sterelny and Griffiths <a class="reference external" href="https://paperpile.com/c/lwDPbc/rVc1">(Sterelny and Griffiths 1999)</a> invoke Sober’s <a class="reference external" href="https://paperpile.com/c/lwDPbc/08Ck">(Sober 1993b)</a> distinction between “source laws” and “consequence laws”. Source laws explain the origins of fitness differences, whereas consequence laws explain the actual evolutionary outcome of these differences. Sterelny and Griffiths judge that the role of ecology is to define the source laws in evolutionary biology.<br />
However, I claim that the results of this paper indicate that this conclusion is incorrect, given the balanced nature of the current collaboration between ecology and evolutionary biology. Ecology and evolutionary biology have clearly made reciprocal contributions to each other’s conceptual advancement. Thus While some may consider the future of ecology as a whole to lie in a stronger integration into the human social context <a class="reference external" href="https://paperpile.com/c/lwDPbc/WSwP">(Kingsland 1985)</a>(pp 65-66) <a class="reference external" href="https://paperpile.com/c/lwDPbc/mDgv+KQ8r+A4SO">(G. A. Bradshaw and Bekoff 2001; Yrjö Haila and Taylor 2001; Yrjšo Haila and Levins 1992)</a>, the progress of the evolutionary ecology synthesis suggests that while parts of ecology might indeed have a important social role, a large part of ecology might actually come to rest in an synthetic theory that comprises a more sturdy theoretical foundation than either discipline alone. Neither discipline is theoretically redundant either to each other, or to biology as a whole. While the existence of laws in biology is an important issue, it is perhaps time to consider the theoretical and philosophical implications of the ongoing reunification of the two disciplines that were born together with Darwin’s theory, which marks the birth of modern biology itself.</p>

<h2>Conclusion<a class="headerlink" href="#conclusion" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>In this Chapter we have examined the alliance between ecology and evolutionary biology, which has been a distinct program of research for more than a century now. In particular swe will focus on the most theoretically and empirically tangible part of this alliance: the unification of population ecology and population genetics. The potential benefits of this unification are wide ranging, and it has been sought for more than half a century now. We began by highlighting the disparities between ecological and evolutionary viewpoints and reviewed aspects of their history that point at the roots of discord as well as efforts for synthesis. There are three important differences in viewpoints that population genetics and population ecology differ at: the role of processes at different time-scales, demographic considerations (including measures of fitness), and environmental heterogeneity. Based on these, a taxonomy of theoretical approaches that merge these two disciplines was presented, with focus on their conceptual approach, themes of research, and empirical advances. This allowed an evaluation of the current status of the synthesis - it is clear that the unification of population biology through an evolutionary ecology synthesis has made steady progress, but remains a work in progress. The nature of this unification also calls for a re-evaluation of the reasons for which ecology has been considered a sterile subject by philosophers. The current structure of the synthesis clearly indicates a balanced role for the two disciplines in the conceptual advancement of biology, and philosophers should perhaps pay more attention to the progress of this synthesis. This will also perhaps be a refreshing diversion from the rather bedraggled issue of the existence of laws in ecology and in biology.</p>

<h3>Footnotes<a class="headerlink" href="#footnotes" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<!-- Some key recommendations and areas for revision / updating:

### **1\. New Theoretical Insights and Themes**

* **Eco-Evolutionary Dynamics**: Emphasize how eco-evolutionary feedbacks integrate both ecology and evolutionary biology, showcasing research on how evolutionary changes can affect ecological interactions and vice versa (e.g., Palkovacs et al., 2018).  
* **Adaptive Dynamics**: Expand on adaptive dynamics as a formal framework for studying evolutionary outcomes in ecological contexts, highlighting recent advancements and applications (e.g., Kisdi, 2010).  
* **Niche Construction**: Discuss how organisms can shape their own selective environments, integrating this with ecological theory to highlight mutual impacts (Laland et al., 2016).

### **2\. Updated Empirical Examples**

* **Rapid Evolution in Natural Populations**: Provide examples from recent studies showing real-time evolution, such as guppy life-history evolution in response to predation (Reznick et al., 1997; Travis et al., 2014).  
* **Microbial Evolution Experiments**: Highlight long-term experiments with *E. coli* (e.g., Lenski's experiments) that reveal evolutionary and ecological principles in action (Lenski et al., 2015).  
* **Climate Change Impacts**: Use contemporary examples to discuss how climate change drives rapid evolutionary responses and shifts in population dynamics (e.g., Franks et al., 2018).

### **3\. Contemporary Challenges and Critiques**

* **Philosophical Implications**: Expand the philosophical exploration of whether ecology and evolutionary biology can be fully unified, considering recent critiques of reductionism and the debate on predictive models (e.g., Sterelny and Griffiths, 2019).  
* **Data Integration Challenges**: Discuss the difficulties in integrating large-scale ecological data with evolutionary models due to complexity and variability in environmental interactions.

### **4\. Methodological Advances**

* **Genomic Tools and Phylogenetics**: Highlight the role of whole-genome sequencing in connecting phylogenetic history with ecological traits and evolutionary processes.  
* **Computational Ecology**: Explore how computational tools, such as agent-based modeling and machine learning, have revolutionized the analysis of eco-evolutionary systems (e.g., Schreiber et al., 2021).

### **5\. Additional Citations and References**

* Integrate more recent references, such as:  
  * Laland, K. N., Matthews, B., & Feldman, M. W. (2016). "An update on niche construction theory."  
  * Palkovacs, E. P., Kinnison, M. T., Correa, C., et al. (2018). "Eco-evolutionary feedbacks in community and ecosystem ecology."  
  * Franks, S. J., Weber, J. J., & Aitken, S. N. (2018). "Evolutionary and plastic responses to climate change in terrestrial plant populations."

### **6\. Emerging Topics for Discussion**

* **Evolutionary Rescue**: Introduce how populations facing environmental changes may evolve rapidly to avoid extinction, drawing on cases of evolutionary rescue.  
* **Anthropocene Impacts**: Discuss how human-induced changes create novel selective pressures and ecological shifts, which merge evolutionary and ecological responses.  
* **Trait-Based Approaches**: Expand on how trait-based frameworks can elucidate the intersection of evolutionary adaptation and ecological dynamics.

**Include adaptive dynamics \- (Kisdi, 2010\)**

<p>Ideas of population growth, which formed the basis for Darwin’s theory of natural selection predate the theory of natural selection in Malthus’ treatise on populations in 1798, and the mathematical formulation of the first model of regulated (“logistical”) population growth, by Verhulst <a class="reference external" href="https://paperpile.com/c/lwDPbc/WSwP">(Kingsland 1985)</a> (pp. 64-66).</p>

<p>Efforts to fuse genetics and ecology were also made in the Russian school of ecology by people such as V.V. Stanchinskii <a class="reference external" href="https://paperpile.com/c/lwDPbc/WSwP">(Kingsland 1985)</a>(pp. 150, 157-160) <a class="reference external" href="https://paperpile.com/c/lwDPbc/ROCY">(Mirzoyan 1996)</a>, the details of which I am unable to access.</p>

<p>“Cultural differences” has been invoked as a reason for lack of communication between the two disciplines by proponents of the population genetics – population ecology synthesis. For example, Roughgarden <a class="reference external" href="https://paperpile.com/c/lwDPbc/Ccks">(J. Roughgarden 1979)</a> says,<em>”The fusion of population genetics with population ecology can be compared to a prearranged marriage between partners who speak different languages. Although both families agree that the marriage is advantageous, it is somewhat difficult to achieve because of cultural differences.”</em></p>

<p>In its objectives and methods, this field is now barely distinguishable from a recent off-shoot of ecology called “Molecular Ecology”, which originated in the 1990’s as a program to use molecular genetic methods to address problems in conservation biology, but then ceased to be a purely applied field, expanding and converging in its objectives and methods on Ecological Genetics. This is an interesting example of an inadvertent convergence of ecological and evolutionary fields driven by a common motivation.</p>
