# Introduction

This MQB section builds on the computing component, introducing you to basic
Data Science including visualization and statistical analyses of data. 

You will learn basic to somewhat advanced
[*frequentist*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequentist_inference) statistical
methods ad inference in a hands-on on way, interspersed with lectures on
underlying concepts.

```{note}
The chapters in this Section assume that you have already worked through at least the basic sections of the [R Chapter](./notebooks/R.ipynb) of this book.
```

It is important that you work through the problems in each chapter, particularly
as some of the questions ask you to find out about commands and functions not
introduced in the chapter's text itself, but which will be relied on in later
chapters.
