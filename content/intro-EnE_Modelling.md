# Introduction

This MQB section is aimed at teaching you core concepts, theories, mathematical
models, and modelling methods in Ecology and Evolution.

Outline:

  * (Brief) history of Ecology and Evolutionary biology and theory
    * Interlinkages between the two fields
    * Gimme some time - ecological vs evolutionary dynamics
  * Real world applications in
    * Microbial ecology and engineering
    * Fisheries
    * Global change
    * Agriculture
    * Disease
    * Etc
  * Structure of this section
    * We will go from individual (single cells, organisms) to ecosystem levels
    * We will integrate ecology and evolution (as seamlessly as possible) at each level 
  * Pre-requisites
    * Maths
      * Each chapter linked to specific maths appendix sections for pre-requisites (Move current maths materials to a single Appendix)
      * Bifurcation analyses / theory
    * Computing
      * Python
    * Jupyter
