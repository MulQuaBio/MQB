# Computing

This part gets you comfortable with the command line, version control, and the core tools used throughout MQB.

## You will learn

- Navigate files/directories efficiently (terminal basics)
- Write small shell scripts for reproducible workflows
- Use `git` to version-control your work and collaborate
- Work with LaTeX for scientific writing
- Get started with Python and R in a reproducible project setup

## Prerequisites

- None assumed.
- If you are brand new to Jupyter, see the [Jupyter introduction appendix](notebooks/appendix-jupy-intro).

## Do this first

1. Start with [Unix](notebooks/unix)
2. Then [Git](notebooks/git)
3. Then pick your primary language: [Python](notebooks/python) and/or [R](notebooks/r)

## Where this goes next

Most later chapters assume you can:
- run commands in a terminal,
- manage files with relative paths,
- and pull/update the course repo with `git`.
