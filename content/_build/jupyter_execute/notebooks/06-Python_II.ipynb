For example, in the above output, `cumtime` is much higher than `tottime` for `my_join` than for `my_squares`. This is because the sub-function (method) `join` is taking an additional 2.502 seconds (due to 10000001 calls), giving a `cumtime` of 2.698 + 2.502 = 5.2 seconds. In comparison, the sub-function (method) `append` is taking an additional 0.397 seconds (due to 10000008 calls), giving a `cumtime` of 3.335 + 0.397 = 3.732 seconds.

In other words, `.join`ing the string, and `.append`ing values to a list repeatedly are both not particularly fast, though the latter is less costly.\n",

For example, `your@email.com` is a specific sequence of characters, but, in fact, all email addresses have such a pattern: alphanumeric characters, a \"@\", alphanumeric characters, a \".\", alphanumeric characters.

So, for example, `ra+t` will match \"rat\" (one 'a' is present) and \"raaat\" (three \"a\"s), but won't match \"rt\".
