# Advanced Data Analyses and Statistics

This part builds toward modern statistical modelling and inference workflows used in quantitative biology.

## You will learn

- Generalised linear models (GLMs)
- Nonlinear least squares (NLLS)
- Likelihood-based inference and maximum likelihood estimation (MLE)

## Prerequisites

- Comfort with R and basic statistics.
- Recommended: complete the basic statistics part first.
- Helpful refresher: [Pre-work exercises](notebooks/mqb-prework-exercises) (probability/likelihood/optimisation).

## Do this first

1. [GLMs](notebooks/glms)
2. [NLLS](notebooks/nlls)
3. [MLE](notebooks/mle)
