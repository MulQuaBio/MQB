# Basic Data Analyses and Statistics

This part introduces practical data analysis in R and the core frequentist toolkit used throughout the book.

## Introduction

This MQB section builds on the computing component, introducing you to basic data science including visualization and statistical analyses of data.

You will learn basic to somewhat advanced [*frequentist*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequentist_inference) statistical methods and inference in a hands-on way, interspersed with lectures on underlying concepts.

```{note}
The chapters in this Part assume that you have already worked through at least the basic sections of the [R chapter](notebooks/r) of this book.
```

It is important that you work through the problems in each chapter, particularly as some of the questions ask you to find out about commands and functions not introduced in the chapter text itself, but which will be relied on in later chapters.

## You will learn

- Data wrangling and plotting basics
- Experimental design concepts and workflow
- Classic hypothesis tests (t-tests, ANOVA)
- Regression and multiple explanatory variables
- Model simplification and interpretation

## Prerequisites

- Basic comfort with R syntax and running code.
- If needed, review the [R chapter](notebooks/r) first.

## Do this first

Start with [Data wrangling in R](notebooks/data-r).

## Suggested route

A typical sequence is:
- [Experimental design](notebooks/exp-design) → [t-tests](notebooks/t-f-tests) → [Regression](notebooks/regress)
- Then [ANOVA](notebooks/anova) and the multiple explanatory variable chapters.
