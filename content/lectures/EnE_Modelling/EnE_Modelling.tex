  \item Ecosystem-scale models 
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Seek to model the cycling of carbon within specific ecosystems (e.g, in pond, lake, ocean, soil, grassland, forest) 
      \item Often focus on net Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emission vs sequestration (absorbtion / storage)
      \item They often ignore feedbacks between the biological (e.g., the food web) and physical (e.g., water or soil chemistry) components of the ecosystem
    \end{itemize}
    \item Global-scale models
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Seek to model the cycling of carbon {\it across} ecosystems 
      \item Typically, they are global- (Earth-) scale models 
      \item They typically include feedbacks between the biological and physical components of the Globe (therefore, AKA ``Earth system models, or ESMs'')

    \item Compartment-based models

    \begin{itemize} 
      \item[+] Relatively simple, require less parameterisation
      \item[-] Assume steady state, so cannot capture dynamics, or include effects of changing species composition (e.g., driven by climate change)
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item Food web-based models
    \begin{itemize} 
      \item[+] Can provide predictions based on a steady state assumption, or can model changes in dynamics/abundances of component populations driven by factors such as climate change
      \item[+] So can potentially predict future trends in ecosystem carbon cycling
      \item[-] Difficult to parameterise (same issues as multi-species fisheries models, and same potential solution, using metabolic scaling)

    \begin{itemize}[<+->] \setlength{\itemindent}{0em} \itemsep6pt
  
      \item Mechanistic Modelling is key to {\it predictive} Models in Global Change Biology 
      
      \item Species' body sizes determine their population growth rate and population size
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Therefore size also predicts the robustness to and recovery from perturbations of species' populations in both fisheries and carbon cycle models
      \end{itemize} 

      \item Fisheries Models have historically not been particularly accurate or forward looking (predictive)
        \begin{itemize}
          \item Using metabolic theory to develop more mechanistic. muti-species fisheries  models is necessary (and is a work in progress) 
        \end{itemize}  
        
        \item Metabolic theory can be used to model the balance of  whole-ecosystem respiration and primary production (Ecosystem-scale carbon cycle models)

        \begin{itemize}
          \item Because environmental temperature determines metabolic rate, and most life on earth is ectothermic
