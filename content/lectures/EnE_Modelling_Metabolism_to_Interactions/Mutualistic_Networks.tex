  \begin{itemize}[<+->]\setlength{\itemindent}{0em} \itemsep3pt
    \item {\bf Mutualistic Networks}: Network of interactions made of pairs of individuals or (usually species') populations {\it mutually benefiting} each other
    \item The benefit can be through direct exchange of matter/energy/metabolites/nutrients 
      \begin{itemize}\setlength{\itemindent}{-1em} 
        \item Plant-fungal (especially, Mycorrhizal) soil interaction networks
        \item Bacterial interaction networks---mutualisms can develop by exchange of organic substrates/metabolites between populations (e.g., Yogurt and Cheese!)
      \end{itemize} 
      \item Or through combination of direct and indirect benefits
      \begin{itemize}\setlength{\itemindent}{-1em} 
        \item Plant-Pollinator Networks: Pollination is an indirect benefit to the plant, nectar is a direct (energy) to the pollinator
        \item Plant-Animal seed dispersal Networks: Also an indirect-direct benefit combination 
        \item Ant-Plant association networks: Plant gets protection (direct, but non-energy benefit), Ants get nectar (energy) 
      \end{itemize}

        \item Most work has been done on Plant-Pollinator networks
        \begin{itemize}
          \item These are called ``bipartite'' networks because the nodes are at only two levels: Plants and Pollinators
        \end{itemize}
        \item {\it Nestedness} is considered to be an important feature for the system's {\it stability} and {\it resilience} (coming up)
        \item Interaction {\it generalization} vs {\it specialization} is also considered important (coming up)
        \item Mutualistic networks have {\it Modules}\footnotemark
        \begin{itemize}
          \item But modules in these systems are less easy to identify and are poorly understood

        \item {\bf Nestedness of a network}: a network structural pattern where specialist pollinators species visit plant species that are subsets of those visited by more generalist pollinators 
        \item Means that the network has a ``strong'' core of highly connected generalists
        \begin{itemize} 
          \item A generalist pollinator visits and pollinates many different plant species (same criteria can be applied to plants)

        plants are pollinated by generalist animals, but generalist plants are
        pollinated by both specialist and generalist pollinators\footnotemark
        \item All these properties have been linked to {\it robustness} of pollination networks to species loss:
        \begin{itemize}
          \item If you remove a random  species in a more nested network, it is less likely to collapse

\section{\scshape Summary}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
  \begin{frame}{Summary}
  
    \begin{itemize}[<+->] \setlength{\itemindent}{0em} \itemsep10pt
      \item Mutualistic networks are important for many ecosystem ``services'' (e.g., pollination)
      
      \item The structure of mutualistic networks affects their stability, resilience, and robustness  
        
      \item Nestedness is believed to enhance the robustness (and stability) of mutualistic networks  (but this is still debated)

      \item Plant-Pollinator networks can change over time (but this is poorly understood)
      
      \item Microbial networks can rapidly switch from being competitive to cooperative (mutualistic) over time
    \end{itemize}
  
  \end{frame}  

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Discussion Questions}

  \begin{enumerate}\setlength{\itemindent}{-1em}\itemsep4pt
    
    \item What are the differences between trophic (e.g., food web) and mutualistic networks?
    
    \item Can we truly study Mutualistic and Trophic networks separately?
    
    \item What role might body size play in Mutualistic (e.g., plant-pollinator) networks? 
    
    \item How do you thing global climate change might affect plant-pollinator networks and pollination services? 
      
    \item How do you think increasing mutualism increases the rate of microbial
    community functioning (e.g., decomposition of leaf litter)? What role can
    temperature play in this? How does this relate to the global carbon cycle?
    (Hint: Leaf litter decomposition releases CO$_2$ )
