  \begin{frame}{Summary}
  
    \begin{itemize}[<+->] \setlength{\itemindent}{0em} \itemsep10pt
  
      \item Metabolic rate and biomechanics drive
      species consumer-resource interactions, and therefore consumption rate (through the functional response)
  
      \item Consumer size, consumer-resource size difference, and interaction dimensionality influences consumer-resource interaction (and consumption) rate  
  
      \item Mismatches between species' thermal physiologies also determine
      consumer-resource interaction (and consumption) rate

      \item Consumer-resource population dynamics depend on the metabolic properties of the species (and environmental factors like dimensionality)

    \item What are the main advantages of a consumer (heterotrophic) lifestyle  compared to an producer (autotrophic) one? What are the disadvantages? 

    \item Which is the most common and diverse organisms on planet earth\footnotemark? Why? Think in terms of what type of consumer they are, and what their size is.
        
    \item What did you learn about the role of body size in the coexistence of consumers and resources from the EcoBuilder game? What is the largest consumer on Earth? What is the smallest? In what respects is their ``struggle for existence'' similar? In what respects is it different?

    \item Which consumer(s) on earth operate(s) at the hottest temperatures? Which operate at the coldest? How is their ``struggle for existence'' similar or different?
