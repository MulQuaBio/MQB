          \item \onslide<7-> The equation\footnotemark of the line is $\log_{10}(B) = 1.83 + 0.74 \log_{10}(M)$\par

    \item For example, a mouse weighing approx. 100 g (or 0.1 kg), in order to maintain {\it metabolic balance}:
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Needs to consume $67.61 \times 0.1^{0.74} = 12.3$ kcal / day
        \item Per unit mass (or per-cell), this is $12.3/0.1 = 123$ kcal / (kg $\times$ day)
      \end{itemize}

    \item The origins of this scaling law for metabolic rate is still being debated
    \item One is the ``Heat dissipation'' hypothesis); watch this video \small \url{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUWUHf-rzks}.
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Larger organisms have lower per-cell or per-mass metabolic rate to avoid overheating
    \end{itemize}
    \item There is also the ``WBE (West, Brown, and Enquist) Model'':
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Larger organisms have lower per-cell metabolic rate because they are inherently limited in their their ability to distribute energy and matter to their (trillions of) cells
      \end{itemize}   
    \item The truth is probably a combination of the two hypotheses

\begin{frame}{Discussion Questions}

  \begin{enumerate}\setlength{\itemindent}{-2em}\itemsep3pt
  
    \item Given the way resting metabolic rate scales with body size, what must consumption rate scale like?
    
    \item Why did we focus on {\it resting} (or ``basal'') metabolic rate?

    \item How much energy would a {\it resting} rabbit ($\sim 1$ kg), a human ($\sim 70$ kg, and an Asian elephant ($\sim 4000$ kg) need for metabolic balance\footnotemark,
    \begin{itemize}
      \item at the individual level?
      \item per unit mass?
    \end{itemize}
    \footnotetext{Calculate it using Kleiber's law (allometric/scaling equation), as we did for a mouse}

    \item How does the value you calculated in the previous question compare with the recommended calorie intake for humans? Is it lower or higher? Why?  

    \item What are the optimal temperatures for the enzyme underlying bioluminescence in the two bacteria in the given example? Why might they have different thermal optima?
