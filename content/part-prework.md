# Advanced Modelling & Statistics Pre-work

These are short exercises (with worked solutions) to refresh the core mathematics and statistics ideas that show up repeatedly in modelling and advanced inference.

## You will learn / refresh

- Functions, graphs, and transformations
- Calculus (derivatives/integrals, Taylor series intuition)
- Linear algebra basics (matrices, eigenvalues)
- Differential equation intuition (equilibria, stability)
- Probability and likelihood fundamentals

## Prerequisites

- None required, but it’s most useful if you already know basic algebra.

## Do this first

1. Work through the [Exercises](notebooks/mqb-prework-exercises)
2. Use the [Solutions](notebooks/mqb-prework-solutions) to check your reasoning

## When to use this

- Before the modelling chapters if you feel rusty.
- Before maximum-likelihood / advanced inference chapters.
