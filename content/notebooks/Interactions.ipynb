To do more than just maintain themselves, organisms must consume energy at a rate faster than their metabolic rate. This requires investment in activities such as foraging, which links energy acquisition to body size. For instance, autotrophs utilize photosynthesis, while heterotrophs depend on consuming organic material.\n"
