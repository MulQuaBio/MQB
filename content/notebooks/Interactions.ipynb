This requires expanding the model to account for these new interactions:\n",

    "\n",
    "2. **Consumer Dynamics**:\n",
    "   - Consumer growth is reduced by leakage, as only a fraction of the consumed resources $ (1 - \\sum_b l^i_{ab}) $ contributes to the consumer's biomass.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Resource Dynamics**:\n",
    "   - Resource pools are interconnected via leakage. Resources can gain from the leakage of other resources, creating complex interactions and potential stabilization mechanisms in ecosystems.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Ecological Implications**:\n",
    "   - The inclusion of leakage allows the model to simulate nutrient cycling, detritus feeding, or other real-world ecological processes where energy and matter are not perfectly transferred between trophic levels.\n",
