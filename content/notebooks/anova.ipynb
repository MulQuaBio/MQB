    "Analysis of Variance, is very often a good choice if your response (dependent) variable is continuous, and your  predictor (independent) variables is categorical. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, you will learn to perform an anova, that is, fit this linear model to the data. Specifically, you will learn to[^fn1]:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Visualize the data by plotting boxplots and barplots\n",
    "\n",
    "* Fit an anova to test whether certain factors can explain (partition) the variation in your data\n",
    "\n",
    "* Perform diagnostics to determine whether the factors are explanatory, and whether the Linear Model is appropriate for your data\n",
    "\n",
    "* Explore and compare how much the different levels of a factor explain the variation in your data \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is anova?\n",
    "\n",
    "<u>An</u>alysis  <u>O</u>f  <u>Va</u>riance (anova) is an extremely useful class of Linear models. It is very often appropriate when your response (dependent) variable is continuous, while your predictor (independent) variable is categorical. Specifically, *One-way anova* is used to compare means of two or more samples representing numerical, continuous data in response to a single categorical variable (factor).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    ":::{figure-md} what-is-anova\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./graphics/ANOVA_is_LM.svg\" alt=\"anova example\" width=\"300px\">\n",
    "\n",
    "**A dataset where an anova is appropriate.** Performing an anova on this dataset is the same as fitting the linear model $y  = \\beta_1  + \\beta_2 x_s + \\beta_3 x_a$, where $x_s$ and $x_a$ are two levels (\"treatments\", representing statistically separate populations) within the factor (games console ownership). Here, the first treatment, the control, is captured by the baseline value $\\beta_1$ (the sample with the lowest value, on the far left).\n",
    ":::\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "(One-way) anova tests the null hypothesis that samples from two or more groups (the treatments or factors) are drawn from populations with the *same mean value*. That is, the null hypothesis is that all the groups are random samples from the *same* population (no statistical difference in their means). To do this, anova compares the variance in the data explained by fitting the linear model, to the unexplained variance (the null hypothesis. \n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, in effect, anova asks whether a linear model with a predictor (or explanatory variable) with at least two categorical levels (or factors), better accounts for the variance (Explained Sum of Squares, ESS, see below) than a null model of the form $y  = \\beta_1$ ([Figure 1](what-is-anova)). Thus, anova is just a type of linear model.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this chapter, it will also make more sense to you how/why fitting a linear regression model to the data that we learned [previously](regress.ipynb), of the form $y = \\beta_1  + \\beta_2 x$ (where $x$ is a continuous predictor variable), requires an anova to determine if the model better fits than a null model of the form $y  = \\beta_1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically, one-way anova is used to test for differences among at least three groups, since the two-group (or levels or factors) case can be covered by a $t$-test (see [t & F tests](t-f-tests.ipynb)). When there are only two means to compare, the $t$-test and the F-test are equivalent; the relation between anova and t is given by $F = t^2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "An extension of one-way anova is two-way analysis of variance that examines the influence of two different categorical independent variables on one dependent variable — we will look at multiple predictor variables in the [Multiple Explanatory Variables Chapter](mul-expl.ipynb) onwards.\n",
    "\n",
    "(anova:SoS)=\n",
    "## Calculating the anova test statistic\n",
    "\n",
    "anova uses of the [F-Statistic](t-f-tests.ipynb). To this end, an anova \"partitions\" variability in your data as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Total sum of squares (TSS)**: This is the sum of the squared difference between the observed dependent variable values (the $y$'s) and the mean of the response variable (denoted by $\\bar{y}$), i.e.,\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "    \\text{TSS} = \\sum_{i=1}^{n}(y_i - \\bar{y})^2\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "TSS tells us how much variation there is in the dependent variable without having any other information (your null model). You might notice that TSS is the numerator of the *sample variance* (or it's square-root, the *sample standard deviation*), which you learned about [previously](exp_design-descriptive-stats).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explained sum of squares (ESS)**: Sum of the squared differences between the predicted $y$'s (denoted by $\\hat{y}$'s) and $\\bar{y}$, or,\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "    \\text{ESS} = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (\\hat{y}_i - \\bar{y})^2\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "ESS tells us how much of the variation in the dependent variable our alternative (linear) model was able to explain by measuring variation in the *modelled* $y$ values (the $\\hat{y}$'s). In othjer words, it measures the reduction in uncertainty that occurs when the linear model is used to predict the responses. \n",
    "\n",
    "**residual sum of squares (rSS)**: Sum of the squared differences between the observed $y$'s (denoted by $y_i$ for the $i^{th}$ observation) and the predicted $\\hat{y}$, or,\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "    \\text{rSS} = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (\\hat{y}_i - y_i)^2\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "rSS tells us how much of the variation in the dependent variable our model could not explain. That is, it's the uncertainty that remains even after the linear model is used. The linear model is considered to be statistically significant if it can account for a large amount of variability in the response.\n",
    "\n",
    "* And of course, TSS = ESS + rSS. That is, the OLS method \"decomposes\" the total variation in the dependent variable into an explained component (ESS; explained by the predictor) and an unexplained or residual component (the rSS).\n",
    "\n",
    "The sums of squares used to calculate the statistical significance of the linear model (regression, anova, etc) through the F value are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "|Type of Sum of Squares (SS)| SS Calculation | Degrees of Freedom (DF)|Mean Sum of Squares (MSS) | \n",
    "|:------|:------:|:------:|:------:|\n",
    "|TSS | $\\sum_{i=1}^{n}(y_i - \\bar{y})^2$ | $n-1$ | $\\frac{TSS}{n-1}$ |\n",
    "|ESS | $\\sum_{i=1}^{n} (\\hat{y}_i - \\bar{y})^2$ | $n_c-1$ | $\\frac{ESS}{n_c-1}$ |\n",
    "|rSS | $\\sum_{i=1}^{n} (\\hat{y}_i - y_i)^2$ | $n-n_c$ |$\\frac{rSS}{n-n_c}$ |\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's try to make sense of these calculations. Firstly, because we are dealing with samples understanding the degrees of freedom is critical. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Degrees of freedom\n",
    "\n",
    "Each sum of squares has a corresponding degrees of freedom (DF) associated with it that gives the Mean Sum of Squares (MSS) — the Sums of Squares divided by the corresponding degrees of freedom.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The TSS DF is one less than the number of observations $n-1$. This is because calculating TSS, needs $\\bar y$ , which imposes loss of one degree of freedom. Note that MSS is thus nothing but the sample variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The ESS DF is one less than the number of coefficients ($n_c$) (estimated parameters) in the model: $n_c-1$. Note that in the case where the linear model is an anova, the number of coefficients equals the number of \"treatments\" (the categories or levels in the predictor or factor). So for example, in [Figure 1](what-is-anova), there are three treatments (predictors) and therefore three coefficients ($\\beta_1$, $\\beta_2$, $\\beta_3$), which means that the ESS degrees of freedom there is $n_c-1 = 2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The rSS DF is the sample size $n$ minus the number of coefficients that you need to estimate ($n_c$), that is, $n - n_c$, because each estimated coefficient is an unknown parameter.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### The F-Value (or ratio)\n",
    "\n",
    "The F-Value or F-ratio, the test statistic used to decide whether the linear model fit is statistically significant, is the ratio of the Mean ESS to the Mean rSS: \n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "F = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{ESS}{n_c-1}\\right)}{\\left(\\frac{rSS}{n-n_c}\\right)}\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "If the null hypothesis that the group means are drawn from sub-populations with the *same* mean were indeed true, the between-group variance (numerator in this F-ratio) should be lower than the within-group variance (denominator). The null hypothesis is rejected if this F-ratio is large — the model explains a significant amount of variance, and we can conclude that the samples were drawn from populations with different mean values.\n",
    "\n",
    "The p-value is calculated for the overall model fit using the F-distribution as you learned before, in [t & F tests](t-f-tests.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "Also note that the root Mean Square Error (rMSE), also known as the standard error of the estimate, is the square root of the Mean rSS. It is the standard deviation of the data about the Linear model, rather than about the sample mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The r$^2$\n",
    "\n",
    "The r$^2$, also called the Coefficient of Determination, is the proportion of total error (TSS) explained by the model (ESS), so the ratio ESS/TSS. That is it is the proportion of the variability in the response that is explained by the fitted model. Since TSS = ESS + rSS, r$^2$ can be rewritten as (TSS-rSS)/TSS = 1 - rSS/TSS. If a model has perfectly fits the data, $r^{2}=1$, and if it has no predictive capability $r^{2}=0$. In reality, r$^2$ will never be exactly 0 because even a null model will explain some variance just by chance due to sampling error. Note that $r$, the square root of r$^2$, is the multiple correlation coefficient: the correlation between the observed values ($y$), and the predicted values ($\\hat{y}$).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Adjusted r$^2$\n",
    "\n",
    "As additional predictors (and therefore linear model coefficients) are added to a linear model, r$^2$ increases even when the new predictors add no real predictive capability. The adjusted-r$^2$ tries to address this problem of over-specification or over-fitting by including the degrees of freedom: Adjusted r$^2$ = 1 - (rSS/$n-n_c-2$)/(TSS/$n-1$) [^fn2]. \n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, additional predictors with little explanatory capability will increase the ESS (and reduce the rSS), but they will also have lower rSS degrees of freedom (because of the additional number of fitted coefficients, $n_c$'s)[^fn3]. Thus if the additional predictors have poor predictive capability, these two reductions will cancel each other out. In other words, the Adjusted r$^2$ penalizes the addition of new predictors to the linear model, so you should always have a look at the Adjusted r$^2$ as a corrected measure of r$^2$.\n",

    "That is, the `barplot` function no only plots bars, but also returns where the middle of the bars are on the x-axis, which we have stored in `barMids`. These values are numeric even though the x-axis represents a categorical variable because these are *locations* of the bars' midpoints in the plot's x-scale.   \n",

    "Then, we used the [`arrows` function](https://stat.ethz.ch/r-manual/r-devel/library/graphics/html/arrows.html) to add error bars. This function draws arrows between any two pairs of points (coordinates) `(x0,y0)` and `(x1,y1)` (in this case, `x0` and `x1` = `barMids`). The `ang=90` directive plots the arrow as a flat line by setting the arrow's angle (see what happens when you run the same pair of commands, but with `ang=50`, or `ang=110`). The `code=3` directive plots both \"arrow\" heads, not just start or end ones (try `code=1` or `code=2` instead and see what happens)."

This is because of the multiple pairwise testing problem mentioned in [t & F tests](t-f-tests.ipynb): if you do lots of tests then you may find small $p$ values by chance and say something important is going on when it is just random chance. This is called a false positive or Type I error.\n",

This is important to know because otherwise, a two-way anova would not be appropriate. We will look at interactions in the [Multiple Explanatory Variables Chapter](mul-expl-inter.ipynb).\n",

It is also called a \"goodness of fit\" statistic, because it measures how well the observed distribution of data fits with the distribution that is expected if the variables of which measurements are made are independent. In our mammals example below, the two variables are trophic level and ground dwelling.\n",

However, arranging students into the categories \"Pass\" and \"Fail\" and counting up how many fall in each categories would be appropriate. Additionally, the data in a Chi-square table (see below) should not be in the form of percentages – only count data are allowed!\n",
