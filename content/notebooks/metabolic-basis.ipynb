    "Metabolism is fundamental to the understanding of ecological and evolutionary processes. \n",
    "\n",
    "The laws of thermodynamics are fundamental principles describing how energy and heat behave in physical, chemical, and living systems. As Boltzmann noted {cite}`boltzmann1886`, the *Second Law of Thermodynamics* is fundamental for understanding how biological cells and systems work as well as their ecological and evolutionary dynamics:\n",
    "\n",
    "> In any *spontaneous* process, the total entropy of an *isolated* system can never decrease. Equivalently, it can stay the same (in a reversible process) or increase (in an irreversible process).\n",
    "\n",
    "The two direct implications of this Law are directly relevant to biological systems: \n",
    "\n",
    "* The first implication is the *\"arrow of time\"* — natural processes tend to move toward greater Entropy (disorder). What makes life and biological processes unique (in contrast to purely physical or chemical processes) is that in essence, the purpose of living organisms is to *counteract* this law by producing order (living biomass) from disorder (photons and molecules). At the most fundamental level, this is possible because living organisms are *not isolated* — thay are open systems that continuously exchange energy and matter with their surroundings.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "While organisms maintain or increase their internal order (i.e., decrease entropy locally) by building and organizing complex molecules, they do so by taking in energy from external sources (e.g., sunlight or food) and releasing waste heat and byproducts back into their environment. This flow of energy and matter ultimately does increase the total entropy of the universe. Thus, life's local decrease in entropy comes at the expense of a larger increase in entropy elsewhere, in accordance with the second law.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "* The second implication is that it is impossible to convert heat completely into work without waste (there is no perfect engine) — living organisms like any engine are subject to this limitation, but are typically designed by natural selection to maximise or optimise their energy conversion efficiency. Indeed, Lotka {cite}`lotka1922` made this observation over a 100 years ago:\n",
    "\n",
    "> *It has been pointed out by Boltzmann' that the fundamental object ofcontention in the life-struggle, in the evolution of the organic world, is available energy. In accord with this observation is the principle that,in the struggle for existence, the advantage must go to those organismswhose energy-capturing devices are most efficient in directing available energy into channels favorable to the preservation of the species.*"

    "Energy is a measurable property that quantified an object's capacity to perform work (in a physical sense). In living organisms, a key function is to harness and utilize energy to support growth, maintenance, and reproduction. Plants and other autotrophs capture photons through photosynthesis, transforming light energy into chemical energy stored in glucose. Heterotrophs, such as animals, obtain energy by breaking chemical bonds in organic molecules. A crucial molecule in this process is ATP (adenosine triphosphate), which serves as a primary energy carrier within cells and powers numerous biochemical reactions.\n",

    "Let's start with the basic equations:\n",
    "\n",
    "*Surface area of sphere* $A = 4\\pi l^2$\n",
    "\n",
    "*Volumev of a sphere* $V = \\tfrac{4}{3}\\pi l^3$\n",

    "If the organism/cell has a *constant density* $\\rho$, then its mass $m$ is proportional to its volume:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "    m \\propto V \\propto l^3 \\quad \\Longrightarrow \\quad l \\propto m^{1/3}.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, the *surface-to-volume ratio* is\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "    \\frac{A}{V} \n",
    "    = \\frac{4\\pi l^2}{\\tfrac{4}{3}\\pi l^3} \n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "*That is, as $l$ increases, $\\tfrac{A}{V}$ decreases ($\\propto 1/l$).* \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, in  biological cells, the *surface area* is where exchange of nutrients, oxygen, and waste takes place, while the *volume* represents total metabolic demand (more \"living material\" inside).\n",
    "\n",
    "So, *larger cell radius* $\\rightarrow$ *lower surface-to-volume ratio* $\\rightarrow$ *harder to meet the metabolic needs* of the cell or organism.\n",
    "\n",
    "This leads to the classic geometric argument that metabolic rate $B$ (e.g., oxygen consumption per unit time) is limited by the total surface available for exchange:\n",

    "\n",
    "### Biological implications of the geometric scaling constraint \n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, small cells have a *relatively large surface area* for their volume. They can exchange nutrients and wastes quickly, supporting higher metabolic rates *per unit volume*. In contrast, larger cells (or organisms) have a *relatively smaller surface area* per unit volume. Consequently, they may be limited in how fast they can exchange vital substances, placing a cap on metabolic rate *per unit mass* or *per unit volume*. This is why cells are relatively small: They need *large surface area relative to volume* to ensure adequate exchange of nutrients/oxygen and removal of wastes for the metabolic demands of their volume.\n",

    "## Going beyond geometric constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "Th above surface-to-volume geo biophysical constraint indeed holds at the level of cells, but is not the full story. \n",
    "\n",
    "Empirically, the scaling most multicellular organisms in fact follows a somewhat different exponent ($\\approx \\frac{3}{4}$, known as *Kleiber's law*. This comes from the two additonal constraints: the requirement of heat dissipation and energy distribution (circulation) thorughout the body. We will not cover these here, but if you are intersted, please have a look at the readings at the end of this chapter. "

This relationship explains the characteristic thermal performance curve observed in biological processes, where rates increase with temperature to an optimum before declining due to enzyme denaturation or other stress factors (Johnson et al., 1974) (which we will consider later below).\n",
    "\n",
    "The *Arrhenius equation* and its variants (often collectively referred to as the \"Boltzmann-Arrhenius\" equation in certain contexts) are cornerstones of chemical kinetics. These formulations describe how reaction rates vary with temperature. For *enzyme kinetics*, the temperature dependence can also be described via modified forms of the Arrhenius equation, sometimes combined with effects such as protein denaturation at higher temperatures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Historically, this work can be traced back to *Jacobus Henricus van 't Hoff* (1852–1911), whose studies first quantified the temperature dependence of reaction rates. Building on van 't Hoff's work, *Svante Arrhenius* (1859–1927) proposed a more explicit relationship that connected the rate constant $k$ of a chemical reaction to an exponential function of temperature:\n",

    "\n",
    "For *enzyme-catalyzed reactions*, temperature significantly affects the reaction velocity $v$ or the turnover number (*catalytic rate constant* $k_{\\mathrm{cat}}$). At \"moderate\" temperatures, higher temperature generally increases reaction rates, consistent with Arrhenius behavior. However, at higher temperatures, *thermal denaturation* of the enzyme reduces or abolishes its catalytic activity. Hence, more realistic models for enzyme kinetics must account for both the *Arrhenius increase in rate* and the *loss of enzyme activity* due to denaturation, which we will consider later below."

    "   - The *Arrhenius Equation* is an empirical formula that captures the exponential increase of reaction rate with temperature.  \n",
    "   - The *Eyring Equation* derives from *Transition State Theory*, relating rate constants to thermodynamic parameters of the transition state ($\\Delta H^\\ddagger$, $\\Delta S^\\ddagger$), as depicted in panels (b) and (c) of the figure.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. *role of Denaturation*  \n",
    "   - Both models in this notebook include a *logistic* denaturation factor to reduce active enzyme at high temperatures. real systems can have more intricate denaturation kinetics, but this simple approach captures the key idea: above a certain threshold, enzyme function declines rapidly.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. *Bell-Shaped Curve*  \n",
    "   - Combining an *Arrhenius- or Eyring-like increase* at moderate temperatures with *denaturation* at higher temperatures typically yields the *bell-shaped* temperature-activity curve depicted in many enzyme-kinetics references.  \n",
    "   - As shown in panel (d), enzymatic rates may also be viewed in the context of substrate concentration and Michaelis–Menten parameters, but the main driver at high temperature is denaturation.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. *Parameter Interpretation*  \n",
    "   - *Arrhenius*: $E_a$ (J/mol) is the activation energy barrier.  \n",
    "   - *Eyring*: $\\Delta H^\\ddagger$ (J/mol) is the enthalpy of activation; $\\Delta S^\\ddagger$ (J/(mol·K)) is the entropy of activation. A large positive $\\Delta S^\\ddagger$ can lead to higher rates, while a large positive $\\Delta H^\\ddagger$ lowers the rate.\n",

We will use microbes as a model because of the relative simplicity of their growth process, which relies on simple cell division.\n",
    "\n",
    "### From intracellular reaction rates to cell growth\n",
    "\n",
    "A living cell's *growth and division* require a *multitude of coupled enzyme reactions* (for nutrient uptake, biosynthesis, energy generation, etc.). MTE assumes that *one key rate‐limiting step* (or a small set of them) dominates the overall pace of cell growth and division. If those rate‐limiting reactions follow Arrhenius‐type kinetics, then the *cellular physiological rate* (e.g., biomass production rate, cell cycle progression rate) will inherit a similar temperature dependence:\n",

    "\n",
    "Because cellular biochemical events occur stochastically (randomly), the *exact* division time of any one cell can vary. However, in an *exponential (log) growth phase* with abundant nutrients, the *average* cell‐division rate $\\lambda$ (divisions per unit time) is fairly constant (Jafarpour et al 2020).
