This folder contains the **notebook files** used for the practicals.

PDF keynotes from the **lecture sessions** can be found in the `lectures\` folder.

This folder contains 4 main notebooks that we will use in the practicals.

- `N1.probability.ipynb`
- `N2.penguins.ipynb`
- `N3.cell_competition.ipynb`
- `N4.nucleotide_substitution.ipynb`

The rest of the files contain either data or auxiliary functions used in the main notebooks
