    "Many of you will deal with complex data — and often, lots of it. Ecological and Evolutionary data are particularly complex because they contain large numbers of attributes, often measured in very different scales and units for individual taxa, populations, etc. In this scenario, storing the data in a database makes a lot of sense! You can\n",
    "easily include the database in your analysis workflow — indeed, that's why people use databases. And you can use Python (and r) to build, manipulate and use your database.\n",
    "\n",
    "### relational databases\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A *relational* database is a collection of interlinked (*related*) tables that altogether store a complex dataset\n",
    "in a logical, computer-readable format. Dividing a dataset into multiple tables minimizes redundancies. For example, if your data were sampled from three sites — then, rather than repeating the site name and description in each row in a text file, you could just specify a numerical \"key\" that directs to another table containing the sampling site name and description.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, if you have many rows in your data file, the type of sequential access we have been using in our `python` and `R` scripts is inefficient — you should be able to instantly access any row regardless of its position\n",
    "\n",
    "Data columns in a database are usually called *fields*, while the rows are the *records*. Here are a few things to\n",
    "keep in mind about databases:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Each field typically contains only one data type (e.g., integers, floats, strings)\n",
    "* Each record is a \"data point\", composed of different values, one for each field — somewhat like a Python tuple\n",
    "* Some fields are special, and are called *keys*:\n",
    "    * The *primary key* uniquely defines a record in a table (e.g., each row is identified by a unique number)\n",
    "    * To allow fast retrieval, some fields (and typically all the keys) are indexed — a copy of certain columns that can be searched very efficiently.\n",
    "    * *Foreign keys* are keys in a table that are primary keys in another table and define relationships between the tables\n",
    "\n",
    "The key to designing a database is to minimize redundancy and dependency without losing the logical consistency of tables — this is called *normalization* (arguably more of an art than a science!)\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at a simple example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you recorded body sizes of species from different field sites in a single text file (e.g., a `.csv` file) with the following fields:\n",
    "\n",

    "`SQLite` is a simple (and very popular) SQL (Structured Query Language)-based solution for managing localized, personal databases.

    "|  `BLOB` | The value is a blob of data, stored exactly as it was input (useful for binary types, such as bitmap images or pdfs) |\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically, you will build a database by importing csv data — be aware that:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Headers: the csv should have no headers\n",
    "* Separators: if the comma is the separator, each record should not contain any other commas\n",
    "* Quotes: there should be no quotes in the data\n",
    "* Newlines: there should be no newlines\n",
    "\n",
    "Now build your first database in SQLite! We will use as example a global dataset on metabolic traits called *biotraits* that we are currently developing in our lab (should be in your `Data` directory). This dataset contains 164 columns (fields). Thermal response curves for different traits and species are stored in rows. This means\n",
    "that site description or taxonomy are repeated as many times as temperatures are measured in the curve. You can imagine how much redundacy can be here!!!\n",
