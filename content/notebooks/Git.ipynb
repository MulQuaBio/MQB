    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Version control, also known as revision control or source control, is the management and tracking of changes to computer code and other certain other types of data in an automated way.\n",
    "\n",
    "Any project (collections of files in directories) under version control has changes and additions/deletions to its files and directories recorded and archived over time so that you can recall specific versions later. \n",
    "\n",
    "Version control is in fact the technology embedded in the versioning of various word processor and spreadsheet applications (e.g., Google Docs, Overleaf).\n",
    "\n",

    "## Why Version Control?\n",
    "\n",
    "With version control of biological computing projects, you can:\n",
    "\n",
    "* record all changes made to a set of files and directories, including text (usually ASCII) data files, so that you can access any previous version of the files\n",
    "\n",
    "* \"roll back\" data, code, documents that are in plain text format (other file formats can also be versioned; see [section on binary files](#Dealing-with-binary-files) below).\n",
    "\n",
    "* collaborate more easily with others on developing new code or writing documents &ndash; branch (and merge) projects\n",
    "\n",
    "* back up your project (but git is not a backup software - see [sections on binary and large files](#Dealing-with-binary-files) below). \n",

    "## Why git ?\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use git, developed by Linus Torvalds, the \"Linu\" in Linux. This is currently the most popular tool for version control. It is a distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency. It allows multiple developers to work on a project simultaneously without overwriting each other's changes, facilitating collaboration and maintaining a history of all modifications.\n",
    "\n",
    "The man advantages of Git are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Distributed System: Every developer has a complete copy of the project on their computer, including its history.\n",
    "- Efficiency: Fast performance for both local and remote operations.\n",
    "- Data Integrity: Every file and project snapshot is checked for data integrity.\n",
    "- Flexibility: Supports \"non-linear\" development workflows through branching and merging.\n",
    "- Collaboration: Facilitates teamwork by allowing multiple people to work on different parts (typically on separate branches) simultaneously."

The \"local repository\" contains the database of all objects (commits, files (\"blobs\"), directories (\"trees\"), etc.) in your repository along with their metadata. The index and the actual data (the objects) associated with each repo snapshot you commit are all all inside a hidden directory named `.git` that sits within your project directory.\n",

    "   - *Issue*: Forgetting to fetch and merge the latest changes from the remote repository before starting new work.\n",

    "\n",
    "* **Improper Branching Practices**\n",
    "   - *Issue*: Not creating separate branches for new features or bug fixes, or using inconsistent branch naming conventions.\n",
    "   - *Why It's a Problem*: Makes it difficult to manage code changes, track progress, and collaborate effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Poor Commit Hygiene**\n",
    "   - *Issue*: Making large, infrequent commits with vague messages like \"Fixed stuff\" or \"Changes.\"\n",
    "   - *Why It's a Problem*: Hinders the ability to trace specific changes, debug issues, and understand the project's evolution.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Not Handling Merge Conflicts Properly**\n",
    "   - *Issue*: Overwriting code, deleting others' work, or incorrectly resolving conflicts without understanding the implications.\n",
    "   - *Why It's a Problem*: Can introduce bugs, cause loss of important code, and disrupt the functionality of the application.\n",
    "\n",

    "* *Communicate*: Keep open lines of communication with your team about what you're working on.\n",
    "* *Test Before Committing*: Ensure your code compiles and passes tests before pushing.\n",
    "* *Understand Git Commands*: Before using advanced commands like `git reset` or `git rebase`, make sure you understand their effects.\n",
    "* *Use .gitignore Wisely*: Configure your `.gitignore` file to exclude unnecessary or sensitive files.\n",

    "\n",
    "A binary file is computer-readable but not human-readable, that is, it cannot be read by opening them in a text viewer. Examples of binary files include compiled executables, zip files, images, word documents and videos. In contrast, text files are stored in a form (usually ASCII) that is human-readable by opening in a text reader (e.g., gedit). Without some git extensions and configurations (coming up next), binary files cannot be properly version-controlled because each version of the entire file is saved *as is* in a hidden directory in the repository (`.git`).\n",
    "\n",
    "However, with some more effort, git can be made to work for binary formats like `*.docx` or image formats such as `*.jpeg`, but it is harder to compare versions; have a look at [this](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitattributes) and [this](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Attributes)<sup>[1](#git:word)</sup>, and also, [this](https://opensource.com/life/16/8/how-manage-binary-blobs-git-part-7).\n",

    "\n",
    "As such, git was designed for version control of workflows and software projects, *not* large files (say, &gt;100mb) (which may be plain-text or binary). Binary files are particularly problematic because each version of the file is saved *as is* in `.git`, when you have a large number of versions it means that there are the same number of binary files in the hidden directory (for example 100 $\\times$ &gt;100mb files!).\n",
    "\n",
    "*So please do not keep large files (especially binary files) under version control*<sup>[2](#git:largefiles)</sup>. For example, if you are doing GIS work, you may have to handle large raster image files.  Do not bring such files under version control.
