    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Version control, also known as revision control or source control, is the management and tracking of changes to computer code and other certain other types of data in an automated way.\n",
    "\n",
    "Any project (collections of files in directories) under version control has changes and additions/deletions to its files and directories recorded and archived over time so that you can recall specific versions later. \n",
    "\n",
    "Version control is in fact the technology embedded in the versioning of various word processor and spreadsheet applications (e.g., Google Docs, Overleaf).\n",

    "## Why Version Control?\n",
    "\n",
    "With version control of biological computing projects, you can:\n",
    "\n",
    "* record all changes made to a set of files and directories, including text (usually ASCII) data files, so that you can access any previous version of the files\n",
    "\n",
    "* \"roll back\" data, code, documents that are in plain text format (other file formats can also be versioned; see [section on binary files](#Dealing-with-binary-files) below).\n",
    "\n",
    "* collaborate more easily with others on developing new code or writing documents &ndash; branch (and merge) projects\n",
    "\n",
    "* back up your project (but git is not a backup software - see [sections on binary and large files](#Dealing-with-binary-files) below). \n",

    "## Why git ?\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use git, developed by Linus Torvalds, the \"Linu\" in Linux. This is currently the most popular tool for version control. It is a distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency. It allows multiple developers to work on a project simultaneously without overwriting each other's changes, facilitating collaboration and maintaining a history of all modifications.\n",
    "\n",
    "The man advantages of Git are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Distributed System: Every developer has a complete copy of the project on their computer, including its history.\n",
    "- Efficiency: Fast performance for both local and remote operations.\n",
    "- Data Integrity: Every file and project snapshot is checked for data integrity.\n",
    "- Flexibility: Supports \"non-linear\" development workflows through branching and merging.\n",
    "- Collaboration: Facilitates teamwork by allowing multiple people to work on different parts (typically on separate branches) simultaneously."

    "**Best Practices:**\n",
    "- Use the **imperative mood**: \"Add feature\" not \"Added feature\" or \"Adds feature\"\n",
    "- Be **specific**: \"Fix data import bug for CSV files\" not \"Fix bug\"\n",
    "- Explain **why**, not just what: \"Add data validation to prevent negative values\"\n",
    "- For **group work**: Include your initials (e.g., \"JS: Add plotting functions\")\n",

    "Here are some of the key concepts in the working of git: \n",
    "\n",
    "### Repository, workflow and command structure\n",
    "\n",
    "**Repository, workflow and command structure.** - The  \"workspace\" is your working directory - the actual files and folders you see and edit.  The \"index\" is your *staging area* (more on this below) - a place where you can group changes you want to `commit` together. The \"local repository\" contains the database of all objects (commits, files (\"blobs\"), directories (\"trees\"), etc.) in your repository along with their metadata. The index and the actual data (the objects) associated with each repo snapshot you commit are all inside a hidden directory named `.git` that sits within your project directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{figure} ../images/git_data_transport.svg\n",
    ":align: center\n",
    ":alt: git_data_transport\n",
    ":figclass: margin\n",
    "\n",
    "The different components of a git repository and the commands used to move data between them. [Source](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Git_data_flow_simplified.svg).  \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "All git commands must be issued from inside the directory (repository) that you have initialized using `git init`, and within which the hidden `.git` directory resides. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Commits\n",
    "\n",
    "**Commits.** A *commit* is an action or rather, snapshot that records changes to the repository. Each commit typically represents a set of related changes (e.g., bug fixes, a new feature, documentation updates), and is associated with a unique ID (we will see this later), an Author, and a timestamp. This allows you to revert to these individual snapshots and track the history of your project. \n",
    "\n",
    "Git, as opposed to many other version control software you may have encountered (e.g., Word's \"track changes\"), tracks *every version of every file as discrete \"snapshots\"*, rather than just the changes or \"diffs\". Git's snapshot-based approach makes operations like switching between branches or merging changes faster and more reliable. It also allows you to efficiently restore any previous version of the project. Here's a [nice visualisation](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-What-is-Git%3F) of how commits and snapshots work.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Branch\n",
    "\n",
    "**Branch.** A \"branch\" is an independent line of development in a project repository. The default branch is typically called `main` (or `master` for backwards compatibility in older versions of git).\n",
    "\n",
    "New branches can be created at any point in the project's history (we will learn about this later). Branches enable multiple lines of development in a repository, such as working on new features or bug fixes without affecting the stable `main` branch. When a branch is ready, it is \"merged\" back to `main` branch or another branch. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Hash \n",
    "\n",
    "**Hash.** A *commit hash* is a 40-character unique identifier for a commit (You will see these later — they look like: `d94cd91`). It is generated by applying the SHA-1 (Secure Hash Algorithm 1) cryptographic function to the contents and metadata of a Git object. *OK, that was some serious Gobbledygook!* All you need to know is that this hash acts as a unique identifier for all commits, files, directories, and other objects within a Git repo so that you can track specific snapshots of the repo.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Common git commands\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a list of the most common `git` commands:\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Status check:* Use `git status` to see the current state of the repository.\n",
    "- *Stage changes:* Use `git add <file>` to stage files for commit.\n",
    "- *Commit Changes:* Use `git commit -m \"commit message\"` to save changes to the repository.\n",
    "- *View history:* Use `git log` to view commit history.\n",
    "- *Create a branch:* Use `git branch <branch_name>` to create a new branch.\n",
    "- *Switch branch:* Use `git checkout <branch_name>` to switch to a different branch.\n",
    "- *Merge branches:* Use `git merge <branch_name>` to merge changes from one branch to another.\n",
    "- *Clone repository:* Use `git clone <URL>` to copy a repository from a remote server.\n",
    "- *Push changes:* Use `git push` to upload local changes to a remote repository.\n",
    "- *Pull changes:* Use `git pull` to fetch and merge changes from a remote repository."

    "\n",
    "A binary file is computer-readable but not human-readable, that is, it cannot be read by opening them in a text viewer. Examples of binary files include compiled executables, zip files, images, word documents and videos. In contrast, text files are stored in a form (usually ASCII) that is human-readable by opening in a text reader (e.g., gedit). Without some git extensions and configurations (coming up next), binary files cannot be properly version-controlled because each version of the entire file is saved *as is* in a hidden directory in the repository (`.git`).\n",
    "\n",
    "However, with some more effort, git can be made to work for binary formats like `*.docx` or image formats such as `*.jpeg`, but it is harder to compare versions; have a look at [this](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitattributes) and [this](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Attributes)<sup>[1](#git:word)</sup>, and also, [this](https://opensource.com/life/16/8/how-manage-binary-blobs-git-part-7).\n",

Binary files are particularly problematic because each version of the file is saved *as is* in `.git`, when you have a large number of versions it means that there are the same number of binary files in the hidden directory (for example 100 $\\times$ &gt;100mb files!).\n",
    "\n",
    "*So please do not keep large files (especially binary files) under version control*<sup>[2](#git:largefiles)</sup>. For example, if you are doing GIS work, you may have to handle large raster image files.  Do not bring such files under version control.

    "## Collaborative Git Workflows for Group Work\n",
    "\n",
    "When working on group projects, Git enables effective collaboration through structured workflows. This section covers best practices for team-based development, which are particularly important for coursework assessments.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Setting Up for Collaboration\n",
    "\n",
    "**Repository Setup:**\n",
    "1. One team member creates the repository on GitHub/Bitbucket\n",
    "2. Add collaborators with **write access** (push privileges)\n",
    "3. All team members clone the repository to their local machines\n",
    "4. Agree on a workflow and naming conventions before starting\n",
    "\n",
    "**Initial Configuration:**\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Clone the group repository\n",
    "git clone git@github.com:username/group-project.git\n",
    "cd group-project\n",
    "\n",
    "# Verify you're on the main branch\n",
    "git status\n",
    "\n",
    "# Pull the latest changes before starting work\n",
    "git pull origin main\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Branch-Based Development\n",
    "\n",
    "Using branches allows team members to work independently without interfering with each other's code.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Create a Feature Branch:**\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Create and switch to a new branch\n",
    "git checkout -b feature/data-analysis-js\n",
    "\n",
    "# Or create a branch for a specific module\n",
    "git checkout -b module/statistical-models\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Branch Naming Conventions:**\n",
    "- `feature/description` - For new features (e.g., `feature/plotting-functions`)\n",
    "- `bugfix/description` - For fixing bugs (e.g., `bugfix/correct-calculation`)\n",
    "- `module/name` - For specific project modules (e.g., `module/data-cleaning`)\n",
    "- Consider including your initials for clarity (e.g., `feature/analysis-jsmith`)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Work on Your Branch:**\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Make changes to your files\n",
    "# Stage and commit regularly\n",
    "git add myfile.py\n",
    "git commit -m \"JS: Add data cleaning functions\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Push your branch to the remote repository\n",
    "git push origin feature/data-analysis-js\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Meaningful Commit Messages for Collaboration\n",
    "\n",
    "Good commit messages are essential for tracking individual contributions and understanding project history.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Commit Message Best Practices:**\n",
    "- Use the **imperative mood**: \"Add feature\" not \"Added feature\"\n",
    "- Be **specific and descriptive**: \"Add linear regression function\" not \"Update code\"\n",
    "- Include **context**: Explain *why*, not just *what*\n",
    "- For group work: **Prefix with initials** to track contributions (e.g., \"JS: Fix data import bug\")\n",
    "- Keep the first line under 50 characters; add details in subsequent lines if needed\n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples of Good vs Poor Commit Messages:**\n",
    "\n",
    "❌ Poor:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git commit -m \"fixed stuff\"\n",
    "git commit -m \"updated file\"\n",
    "git commit -m \"asdfgh\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ Good:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git commit -m \"JS: Add function to calculate species diversity\"\n",
    "git commit -m \"AM: Fix bug in temperature conversion (Celsius to Kelvin)\"\n",
    "git commit -m \"TK: Add unit tests for data validation functions\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Syncing with the Team\n",
    "\n",
    "Regularly synchronize your work with the main branch to avoid conflicts.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Before Starting Work:**\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Switch to main and pull latest changes\n",
    "git checkout main\n",
    "git pull origin main\n",
    "\n",
    "# Switch back to your feature branch\n",
    "git checkout feature/your-feature\n",
    "\n",
    "# Merge main into your branch to stay updated\n",
    "git merge main\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Daily Workflow:**\n",
    "1. Pull from main at the start of each work session\n",
    "2. Work on your feature branch\n",
    "3. Commit regularly with meaningful messages\n",
    "4. Push your branch to the remote repository\n",
    "5. Before finishing, merge main into your branch again to catch any new changes\n",
    "\n",
    "### Handling Merge Conflicts\n",
    "\n",
    "Merge conflicts occur when two people modify the same lines of code. They are inevitable in collaborative work but can be resolved systematically.\n",
    "\n",
    "**When Conflicts Occur:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Git will notify you of conflicts when you try to merge or pull:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "Auto-merging analysis.R\n",
    "CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in analysis.R\n",
    "Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Identifying Conflicts:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Open the conflicted file. Git marks conflicts like this:\n",
    "```\n",
    "<<<<<<< HEAD\n",
    "# Your changes\n",
    "result <- mean(data$temperature)\n",
    "=======\n",
    "# Their changes  \n",
    "result <- median(data$temperature)\n",
    ">>>>>>> main\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Resolving Conflicts:**\n",
    "1. **Communicate with your team**: Discuss which version to keep or how to combine them\n",
    "2. **Edit the file**: Remove the conflict markers (`<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>`) and keep the correct code\n",
    "3. **Test the resolution**: Make sure the code works\n",
    "4. **Stage and commit**:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   git add analysis.R\n",
    "   git commit -m \"JS: Resolve merge conflict in temperature calculation\"\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Minimizing Conflicts:**\n",
    "- **Divide work clearly**: Assign different files or functions to different team members\n",
    "- **Pull frequently**: Sync with main regularly\n",
    "- **Communicate**: Use issues or comments to coordinate who's working on what\n",
    "- **Small, frequent commits**: Easier to resolve conflicts in small changes\n",
    "\n",
    "### Code Review and Merging\n",
    "\n",
    "Before merging your work into the main branch, have teammates review your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Using Pull Requests (GitHub) / Merge Requests (GitLab):**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Push your branch** to the remote:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   git push origin feature/your-feature\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Create a Pull Request** on GitHub:\n",
    "   - Go to your repository on GitHub\n",
    "   - Click \"Pull requests\" → \"New pull request\"\n",
    "   - Select your feature branch to merge into main\n",
    "   - Add a description of your changes\n",
    "   - Request review from team members\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Review Process**:\n",
    "   - Teammates review the code\n",
    "   - Discuss changes in comments\n",
    "   - Make requested modifications\n",
    "   - Push updates to the same branch (automatically updates the PR)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Merge** when approved:\n",
    "   - Click \"Merge pull request\" on GitHub\n",
    "   - Delete the feature branch after merging\n",
    "   - Pull the updated main branch locally:\n",
    "     ```bash\n",
    "     git checkout main\n",
    "     git pull origin main\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "```{tip}\n",
    "**Code Review Benefits**: Code review isn't just for catching bugs—it helps team members understand all parts of the project, ensures code quality, and provides documentation of who contributed what.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Contribution Documentation\n",
    "\n",
    "For coursework assessments, you must document individual contributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Required: CONTRIBUTIONS.md File**\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a `CONTRIBUTIONS.md` file in your repository documenting:\n",
    "- Who worked on which components\n",
    "- Individual code contributions\n",
    "- Collaboration and communication efforts\n",
    "- Code review participation\n",
    "\n",
    "See the [Group work execution](Appendix-Assessment.md#group-work-execution) section in the Assessment chapter for detailed requirements and use the provided template.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tracking Contributions Through Git:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Your Git history provides evidence of individual work:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# View commits by author\n",
    "git log --author=\"Jane Smith\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# View detailed statistics\n",
    "git shortlog -sn\n",
    "\n",
    "# See who modified each line of a file\n",
    "git blame filename.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```{important}\n",
    "**Assessment Note**: Your Git commit history will be reviewed as part of individual assessment. Make sure to:\n",
    "- Commit your own work under your own name\n",
    "- Use meaningful commit messages\n",
    "- Push regularly to demonstrate ongoing contribution\n",
    "- Maintain accurate CONTRIBUTIONS.md documentation\n",
    "\n",
    "Individual marks account for 40% of group project grades, based on your documented contributions. See the Assessment chapter for full details.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Best Practices for Group Work\n",
    "\n",
    "**Communication:**\n",
    "- Use GitHub Issues or project management tools to track tasks\n",
    "- Comment on commits and pull requests\n",
    "- Hold regular team meetings to coordinate work\n",
    "- Discuss major decisions before implementing them\n",
    "\n",
    "**Organization:**\n",
    "- Agree on code style and formatting (consider using linting tools)\n",
    "- Use consistent file and variable naming conventions\n",
    "- Document your code with clear comments\n",
    "- Write README files for each module or component\n",
    "\n",
    "**Version Control Hygiene:**\n",
    "- Never commit directly to main without review\n",
    "- Keep branches short-lived (merge frequently)\n",
    "- Delete branches after merging\n",
    "- Use `.gitignore` to exclude unnecessary files\n",
    "- Run `git status` before every commit and push\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pre-commit Hooks for Team Consistency:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Set up pre-commit hooks to enforce standards across all team members:\n",
    "\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "# .pre-commit-config.yaml\n",
    "repos:\n",
    "  - repo: https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit-hooks\n",
    "    rev: v4.4.0\n",
    "    hooks:\n",
    "      - id: check-added-large-files\n",
    "        args: ['--maxkb=500']\n",
    "      - id: trailing-whitespace\n",
    "      - id: end-of-file-fixer\n",
    "      - id: check-yaml\n",
    "      \n",
    "  # For Python projects\n",
    "  - repo: https://github.com/psf/black\n",
    "    rev: 23.1.0\n",
    "    hooks:\n",
    "      - id: black\n",
    "        \n",
    "  # For R projects  \n",
    "  - repo: https://github.com/lorenzwalthert/precommit\n",
    "    rev: v0.3.2\n",
    "    hooks:\n",
    "      - id: style-files\n",
    "      - id: lintr\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This ensures all team members follow the same code formatting and quality standards.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conflict Resolution\n",
    "\n",
    "If disagreements arise within the team about technical decisions or contributions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Document the issue**: Write it down clearly\n",
    "2. **Discuss as a team**: Try to reach consensus\n",
    "3. **Consult your supervisor**: If unresolved, seek guidance from course instructors\n",
    "4. **Use the peer assessment process**: The formal peer assessment (see Assessment chapter) provides a mechanism for addressing contribution imbalances\n",
    "\n",
    "For serious issues with team dynamics or non-contributing members, contact your course coordinator early—don't wait until the deadline.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Workflow Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a complete workflow for a typical group work session:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# 1. Start of work session - get latest changes\n",
    "git checkout main\n",
    "git pull origin main\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. Create or switch to your feature branch\n",
    "git checkout -b feature/my-analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3. Work on your code, commit regularly\n",
    "# ... edit files ...\n",
    "git add analysis.py\n",
    "git commit -m \"JS: Add species diversity calculation\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# 4. Sync with main to avoid conflicts\n",
    "git checkout main\n",
    "git pull origin main\n",
    "git checkout feature/my-analysis\n",
    "git merge main\n",
    "# Resolve any conflicts if they occur\n",
    "\n",
    "# 5. Push your branch\n",
    "git push origin feature/my-analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "# 6. Create pull request on GitHub for team review\n",
    "\n",
    "# 7. After approval, merge and cleanup\n",
    "git checkout main\n",
    "git pull origin main\n",
    "git branch -d feature/my-analysis  # Delete local branch\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cross-Reference to Assessment\n",
    "\n",
    "All collaborative Git practices described here support the assessment criteria outlined in the [Assessment chapter](Appendix-Assessment.md). Key points:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Group work quality** (60% of group project marks): Measured by code quality, documentation, testing, and Git repository organization\n",
    "- **Individual contributions** (40% of group project marks): Tracked through Git history, CONTRIBUTIONS.md, and peer assessment\n",
    "- **Repository requirements**: Proper `.gitignore`, meaningful README, clean commit history\n",
    "- **Peer assessment**: Formal process to evaluate team member contributions\n",
    "\n",
    "Effective use of Git not only helps you collaborate but also provides the documentation needed for fair individual assessment."

    "- Did I use `git status` to check what I was adding?\n",
    "- Did I commit regularly enough, whenever I had completed a logical section of work?\n",
