# Ecological & Evolutionary Modelling

This part focuses on building and analysing mechanistic models used in ecology and evolution.

## You will learn

- Translate biological assumptions into mathematical models
- Analyse model behaviour (equilibria, stability, interpretation)
- Connect models to data and biological questions

## Prerequisites

- Comfortable running notebooks and basic code.
- Helpful: the [Pre-work](notebooks/mqb-prework-exercises) if you want a maths refresher.

## Do this first

1. Start with [Metabolic basis](notebooks/metabolic-basis)
2. Then [Populations](notebooks/populations)
3. Then [Interactions](notebooks/interactions)

## References

The book-wide references live in [References](references).
