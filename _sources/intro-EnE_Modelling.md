# Introduction

This MQB section is aimed at teaching you core concepts, theories, mathematical models, and modelling methods in Ecology and Evolution. 

## Overview

We will cover key ecological and evolutionary concepts, models, understand how they behave, and learn to interpret and classify their behaviour using dynamical systems theory and bifurcation analysis. Dynamical systems theory plays a major role in modern theoretical approaches to ecological concepts and phenomena such as competition, predation, metapopulation dynamics and disease spread. This section will introduce some of the key basics of dynamical systems theory in application to these topics. We will look at ordinary differential equations and difference equation models and will use stability analysis and bifurcation analysis as tools to understand the qualitative behaviour of ecological models.

### Structure of this section

We will go from individual (single cells, organisms) to ecosystem levels, integratng ecology and evolution (as seamlessly as possible) at each level. To lay the foundation for this, we will start with a philosphically- and historically-flavored chapter on the (brief) history of Ecology and Evolutionary biology and theory, the interlinkages between the two fields, and the status of their unification into a single discipline. There you will learn that its basically a matter of time scales, and whether and when ecology and evolutionary dynamics play out at the same timescales, and when they can be separated.
