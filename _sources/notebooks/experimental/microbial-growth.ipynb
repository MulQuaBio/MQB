    "\n",
    "But this is just for our single curve, fitting these models to a whole database of different growth rate measurements can pose more problems. In particular, these nls models can be quite fussy about their paramater starting values and fail to converge if these are too far from reality. We implemented some functions to estimate the starting parameters, but these can fail to give decent estimations if there are some oddities in the data. One nice way of getting around this is using the nls.multstart package (from Dan Padfield again - https://github.com/padpadpadpad/nls.multstart) which allows you to specify a general range of starting parameters which it iterates across. It attempts to fit with each set of starting parameters and then chooses the best model fit based on AIC scores. Lets use this on our Gompertz fitting code from before."
