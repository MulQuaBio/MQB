    "After you have been coding for a little bit of time, you may come across some people talking about **object-oriented programming** or **OOP** for short. This could be accompanied by scary words like \"inheritance\", \"overloading\", and \"children\" too. But never fear, for not only is OOP a useful coding paradigm, but it is also incredibly easy to implement in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Object-oriented programming is particularly valuable in scientific computing because it allows you to model real-world entities—organisms, experimental samples, ecological sites—as self-contained units with their own properties and behaviors. This makes your code more intuitive, easier to maintain, and better reflects the structure of biological systems."

    "Put simply, object-oriented programming is a way of thinking about programming outside of the classic \"run this function on this variable\" style. Instead we can think of the data we are considering as an **object**.\n",
    "\n",
    "This object could have properties and things that the object can do. In Python we refer to an object as a `class`, with the properties called `attributes` and the things it can do referred to as `methods`.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can think of a `class` as a template for an object, so if you consider the thing you are sitting on, it is a chair. More specifically it is *that particular chair you are sitting on*. In that vein, you are sitting on an *instance* of class `chair`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other people will have different instances of class `chair`, and each instance is unique, with its own property values. If you cut the leg off your chair, it does not remove a leg from everybody else's chair, just decreases the leg count of your chair by 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why is this useful in biology?** Imagine you're studying a population of organisms. Each organism is an instance of a `Species` class, with attributes like `body_mass`, `age`, and `location`, and methods like `grow()`, `reproduce()`, or `move()`. Instead of managing parallel lists of masses, ages, and locations (and keeping them synchronized), you bundle all the data for each organism together. This makes your code clearer, less error-prone, and more closely mirrors how we think about biological systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "If that all sounds a bit abstract, don't worry. It is. But the vocabulary above will be used throughout and should help you grasp the concepts as we go."

    "- Create properties with `@property`\n",

    "- Build complex objects through composition\n",
    "- Use inheritance to create specialized classes\n",
    "- Create custom exceptions\n",
    "- Avoid common OOP pitfalls\n",
    "\n",
    "**When to use OOP:**\n",
    "- You have data with associated behaviors (organisms with methods like `grow()`, `reproduce()`)\n",
    "- Multiple instances of similar entities (samples, sites, individuals)\n",
    "- Complex systems that benefit from modular design\n",
    "- Building reusable code/packages\n",
    "\n",
    "**When NOT to use OOP:**\n",
    "- Simple scripts with no repeated structure\n",
    "- Pure data analysis pipelines (pandas DataFrames often better)\n",
    "- When functions alone are clearer\n",
    "\n",
    "**Further learning:**\n",
    "- Abstract base classes (`abc` module)\n",
    "- Multiple inheritance and method resolution order (MRO)\n",
    "- Properties with setters and deleters\n",
    "- Class methods (`@classmethod`) and static methods (`@staticmethod`)\n",
    "- Type hints with classes\n",
    "- Design patterns (Factory, Singleton, Observer, etc.)\n",
