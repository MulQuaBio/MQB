    "## Energy and Metabolic Rate\n",
    "Energy is a measurable property of an object that determines its ability to perform work. Life's purpose is to utilize energy for propagating itself through self-replication. Plants and other autotrophs harness photons via photosynthesis, converting light energy into chemical energy stored in glucose. Heterotrophs, such as animals, derive energy from breaking chemical bonds in organic molecules. ATP (adenosine triphosphate) is a critical energy carrier in cells, facilitating various biochemical processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Metabolism, the set of chemical reactions within an organism, determines metabolic rate, which is the rate of energy use, often measured in J/s, kcal/day, or Watts. Organisms must balance energy consumption and expenditure:\n",
