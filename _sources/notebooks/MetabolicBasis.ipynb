    "\n",
    "The laws of thermodynamics are fundamental principles describing how energy and heat behave in physical systems. Of these, the *Second Law*, about Entropy and the direction of processes, is key to understanding how biological cells and systems work, as well as their ecological and evolutionary dynamics:\n",
    "\n",
    "> In any *spontaneous* process, the total entropy of an isolated system can never decrease. Equivalently, it can stay the same (in a reversible process) or increase (in an irreversible process).\n",

    "Both the implications of this Law that are directly relevant to biological systems. \n",
    "\n",
    "The first implication is the \"arrow of time\" — natural processes tend to move toward greater Entropy (disorder). What makes life and biological systems & processes, in contrast to purely physical or chemical systems & processes, is that in essence the purpose of living organisms is to counteract this law by producing order (living biomass) from disorder (photons and molecules). \n",
    "\n",
    "The second implication is that it is impossible to convert heat completely into work without waste (there is no perfect engine); living organisms, like any engine, are subject to this limitation, but are typically designed by natural selection to maximise or optimise their energy conversion efficiency."

    "Energy is a measurable property of an object that determines its ability to perform work. Life's purpose is to utilize energy for propagating itself through self-replication. Plants and other autotrophs harness photons via photosynthesis, converting light energy into chemical energy stored in glucose. Heterotrophs, such as animals, derive energy from breaking chemical bonds in organic molecules. ATP (adenosine triphosphate) is a critical energy carrier in cells, facilitating various biochemical processes.\n",

    "\n",
    "*Surface area* $A$:\n",

    "   A = 4\\pi l^2.\n",
    "$$\n",

    "$$\n",
    "   V = \\tfrac{4}{3}\\pi l^3.\n",

    "\n",
    "If the organism/cell has a *constant density* $\\rho$, then its mass $m$ is proportional to its volume:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "    m \\propto V \\propto l^3 \\quad \\Longrightarrow \\quad l \\propto m^{1/3}.\n",
    "$$\n",

    "Then, the *surface-to-volume ratio* is\n",
    "$$\n",
    "    \\frac{A}{V} \n",
    "    = \\frac{4\\pi l^2}{\\tfrac{4}{3}\\pi l^3} \n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "*That is, as $l$ increases, $\\tfrac{A}{V}$ decreases ($\\propto 1/l$).* \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, in  biological cells, the *surface area* is where exchange of nutrients, oxygen, and waste takes place, while the *volume* represents total metabolic demand (more \"living material\" inside).\n",
    "\n",
    "So, *larger cell radius* $\\Rightarrow$ *lower surface-to-volume ratio* $\\Rightarrow$ *harder to meet the metabolic needs* of the cell or organism.\n",

    "\n",
    "That is, this scaling arises from the fgact that an organism's metabolic rate scales with its ability to exchange materials through a surface (which goes as *length squared*), while its mass (and thus total metabolic demand) goes as *length cubed*.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Biological implications of the geometric scaling constraint \n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, small cells have a *relatively large surface area* for their volume. They can exchange nutrients and wastes quickly, supporting higher metabolic rates *per unit volume*. In contrast, larger cells (or organisms) have a *relatively smaller surface area* per unit volume. Consequently, they may be limited in how fast they can exchange vital substances, placing a cap on metabolic rate *per unit mass* or *per unit volume*. This is why cells are relatively small: They need *large surface area relative to volume* to ensure adequate exchange of nutrients/oxygen and removal of wastes for the metabolic demands of their volume.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Going beyond geometric constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "Th above surface-to-volume geo biophysical constraint indeed holds at the level of cells, but is not the full story. \n",
    "\n",
    "Empirically, the scaling most multicellular organisms in fact follows a somewhat different exponent ($\\approx \\frac{3}{4}$, known as *Kleiber's law*. This comes from the two additonal constraints: the requirement of heat dissipation and energy distribution (circulation) thorughout the body. We will not cover these here, but if you are intersted, please have a look at the readings at the end of this chapter. "

This relationship explains the characteristic thermal performance curve observed in biological processes, where rates increase with temperature to an optimum before declining due to enzyme denaturation or other stress factors (Johnson et al., 1974) (which we will consider later below).\n",
    "\n",
    "The *Arrhenius equation* and its variants (often collectively referred to as the \"Boltzmann-Arrhenius\" equation in certain contexts) are cornerstones of chemical kinetics. These formulations describe how reaction rates vary with temperature. For *enzyme kinetics*, the temperature dependence can also be described via modified forms of the Arrhenius equation, sometimes combined with effects such as protein denaturation at higher temperatures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Historically, this work can be traced back to *Jacobus Henricus van 't Hoff* (1852–1911), whose studies first quantified the temperature dependence of reaction rates. Building on van 't Hoff's work, *Svante Arrhenius* (1859–1927) proposed a more explicit relationship that connected the rate constant $k$ of a chemical reaction to an exponential function of temperature:\n",

    "- $ R $ is the universal gas constant, and  \n",
    "- $ T $ is the absolute temperature in Kelvin.\n",
    "\n",
    "For *enzyme-catalyzed reactions*, temperature significantly affects the reaction velocity $v$ or the turnover number (*catalytic rate constant* $k_{\\mathrm{cat}}$). At \"moderate\" temperatures, higher temperature generally increases reaction rates, consistent with Arrhenius behavior. However, at higher temperatures, *thermal denaturation* of the enzyme reduces or abolishes its catalytic activity. Hence, more realistic models for enzyme kinetics must account for both the *Arrhenius increase in rate* and the *loss of enzyme activity* due to denaturation, which we will consider later below."

    "We can model $k_\\text{cat}(T)$ using either the *Arrhenius* or the *Eyring* Equations. However, because real enzymes *denature* at higher temperatures, we typically observe a *bell-shaped* temperature activity profile.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will now look at *classical transition state theory (TST)*, which provides a *microscopic rationale* for the temperature dependence of reaction rates, explaining both *how energy barriers (enthalpy)* slow down reactions and how *changes in molecular order (entropy)* can further modulate the speed at which reactants cross from the well of the reactants to the well of reaction products.\n",
    "\n",
    "TST was developed in the 1930s by Henry Eyring, Meredith G. Evans, Michael Polanyi, and others. The key idea is that a chemical reaction proceeds through a high-energy configuration of the reactants called the *transition state* (or activated complex).

    "\n",
    "$\\Delta H^\\ddagger$ is the difference in *enthalpy* (heat content) between the transition state (activated complex) and the reactants.

A larger $\\Delta H^\\ddagger$ means a higher barrier, which tends to *slow down* the reaction, especially at lower temperatures.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the factor \\$exp(-\\Delta H^\\ddagger / (RT))$, $\\Delta H^\\ddagger$ appears in the *exponential* term with a $1/T$ dependence.Consequently, the *higher* the activation enthalpy, the *more strongly* the rate constant depends on temperature (i.e., higher sensitivity in an Arrhenius-type plot).\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, $\\Delta S^\\ddagger$ is the difference in *entropy* between the transition state and the reactants. It reflects the *change in molecular disorder* when going from reactants to the activated complex. A *positive* $\\Delta S^\\ddagger$ implies that forming the transition state is relatively more disordered than the reactants, favoring the reaction (larger rate constant).

    "<!-- ## 4. Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "1. *Arrhenius vs. Eyring*  \n",
    "   - The *Arrhenius Equation* is an empirical formula that captures the exponential increase of reaction rate with temperature.  \n",
    "   - The *Eyring Equation* derives from *Transition State Theory*, relating rate constants to thermodynamic parameters of the transition state ($\\Delta H^\\ddagger$, $\\Delta S^\\ddagger$), as depicted in panels (b) and (c) of the figure.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. *Role of Denaturation*  \n",
    "   - Both models in this notebook include a *logistic* denaturation factor to reduce active enzyme at high temperatures. Real systems can have more intricate denaturation kinetics, but this simple approach captures the key idea: above a certain threshold, enzyme function declines rapidly.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. *Bell-Shaped Curve*  \n",
    "   - Combining an *Arrhenius- or Eyring-like increase* at moderate temperatures with *denaturation* at higher temperatures typically yields the *bell-shaped* temperature-activity curve depicted in many enzyme-kinetics references.  \n",
    "   - As shown in panel (d), enzymatic rates may also be viewed in the context of substrate concentration and Michaelis–Menten parameters, but the main driver at high temperature is denaturation.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. *Parameter Interpretation*  \n",
    "   - *Arrhenius*: $E_a$ (J/mol) is the activation energy barrier.  \n",
    "   - *Eyring*: $\\Delta H^\\ddagger$ (J/mol) is the enthalpy of activation; $\\Delta S^\\ddagger$ (J/(mol·K)) is the entropy of activation. A large positive $\\Delta S^\\ddagger$ can lead to higher rates, while a large positive $\\Delta H^\\ddagger$ lowers the rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. *Historical Significance*  \n",
    "   - *Arrhenius* (1889) built on *van 't Hoff's* work on temperature dependence of equilibrium constants and reaction rates.  \n",
    "   - *Henry Eyring* (1935) developed Transition State Theory, leading to the *Eyring-Polanyi equation*, providing a more fundamental theoretical underpinning for temperature-dependent rate processes in chemistry and biochemistry. -->"

Empirical models like the *Ratkowsky model* ($\\sqrt{\\mu}$ vs. $T$) or the *Cardinal model* with minimum, optimum, and maximum temperatures, are often used by biologists instead of explicitly thermodynamic equations.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Below or near a certain threshold temperature, the *maintenance energy* requirement may exceed the energy‐generating reactions, effectively stopping growth.\n",

    "* In single‐cell studies (e.g., time‐lapse microscopy), you see that individual cells have *variable* interdivision times. However, at the *population level*, the *average* behavior typically follows the exponential law (Jafarpour et al 2019).\n",
    "\n",
    "### A more general relationship\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, not just microbial cells, but larger organisms have lower mass-specific metabolic rates, enabling longer lifespans and greater reproductive investment (Savage et al., 2004). That is, population growth rate scales negatively with body size:\n",

    "\n",
    "- *Empirical vs. Theoretical*: Many of the earliest derivations of *temperature‐dependent growth* arose from *empirical fits* (e.g., Arrhenius, Ratkowsky) to experimental microbial data. *Transition State Theory* was largely developed in *physical chemistry* for chemical reactions but has been adapted for *biochemical* and *enzymatic* rate processes.  \n",
    "- *MTE*: Extends these ideas to *whole‐organism* (or *whole‐cell*) metabolism, adding the *allometric* component (\\(M^{3/4}\\) scaling for metabolic rate).  \n",
    "- *Logistic Growth*: Originates in *population ecology* (Verhulst, Pearl & Reed), but it's widely applicable to *microbial cultures* in a *batch* environment with finite resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "Together, these references provide the *theoretical foundation* and *empirical evidence* for deriving and applying *temperature‐ and size‐dependent logistic (and exponential) growth* models in microbial systems. -->"
