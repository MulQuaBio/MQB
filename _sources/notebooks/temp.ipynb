    "### 1. Introduction and Historical Context\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.1. Arrhenius Equation\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the earliest attempts to capture the temperature dependence of reaction rates was pioneered by **Jacobus Henricus van ’t Hoff** (1852–1911), who observed an exponential increase in the rate of chemical reactions with increasing temperature. Later, **Svante Arrhenius** (1859–1927) formalized this relationship in the well-known **Arrhenius Equation**:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\displaystyle k = A \\exp\\Bigl( -\\frac{E_a}{RT} \\Bigr),$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where  \n",
    "- \\(k\\) is the rate constant,  \n",
    "- \\(A\\) is the pre-exponential (frequency) factor,  \n",
    "- \\(E_a\\) is the activation energy,  \n",
    "- \\(R\\) is the universal gas constant, and  \n",
    "- \\(T\\) is the absolute temperature (in Kelvin).\n",
    "\n",
    "For **enzyme-catalyzed reactions**, the same principle applies for the **catalytic rate constant** \\(k_{\\mathrm{cat}}\\), but enzymes also have a **thermal denaturation** process at higher temperatures, causing activity to drop above a certain threshold.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.2. Eyring Equation (Transition State Theory)\n",
    "\n",
    "In the 1930s, **Henry Eyring** (1901–1981) and others developed the **Transition State Theory (TST)**. The key result of TST is the **Eyring-Polanyi Equation**, usually written in the form:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\displaystyle k = \\kappa \\frac{k_B \\, T}{h} \\exp\\Bigl( \\frac{\\Delta S^\\ddagger}{R}\\Bigr) \\exp\\Bigl( - \\frac{\\Delta H^\\ddagger}{RT} \\Bigr),$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where  \n",
    "- \\(\\kappa\\) is the transmission coefficient (often assumed to be ~1 for many simple reactions),  \n",
    "- \\(k_B\\) is the Boltzmann constant,  \n",
    "- \\(h\\) is Planck’s constant,  \n",
    "- \\(\\Delta S^\\ddagger\\) is the entropy of activation,  \n",
    "- \\(\\Delta H^\\ddagger\\) is the enthalpy of activation, and  \n",
    "- \\(R\\) and \\(T\\) are as before.\n",
    "\n",
    "This equation is sometimes called the “**Eyring equation**” and offers a thermodynamics-based perspective. It reduces to an Arrhenius-like form when you group constants appropriately.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.3. Application to Enzyme Kinetics\n",
    "\n",
    "For an **enzyme-catalyzed reaction**, the rate can be written as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\displaystyle \\text{Rate} = k_\\text{cat}(T) \\times [\\text{E}] \\times f([\\text{S}]),$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "- \\(k_\\text{cat}(T)\\) is the turnover number, strongly dependent on \\(T\\),  \n",
    "- \\([\\text{E}]\\) is the enzyme concentration,  \n",
    "- \\(f([\\text{S}])\\) is a function of substrate concentration (such as the Michaelis-Menten form \\(\\tfrac{[\\text{S}]}{K_M + [\\text{S}] }\\)).\n",
    "\n",
    "We can model \\(k_\\text{cat}(T)\\) using either the **Arrhenius Equation** or the **Eyring Equation**. However, because real enzymes **denature** at higher temperatures, we often observe a **bell-shaped** temperature activity profile.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will:\n",
    "1. Demonstrate both the **Arrhenius** and **Eyring** forms for the temperature dependence of \\(k_\\text{cat}\\).  \n",
    "2. Include a simple logistic denaturation function to mimic the loss of enzyme activity at high temperature.  \n",
    "3. Visualize the resulting enzyme activity curves and explore parameter effects."

    "## 4. Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Arrhenius vs. Eyring**  \n",
    "   - The **Arrhenius Equation** is an empirical formula that captures the exponential increase of reaction rate with temperature.  \n",
    "   - The **Eyring Equation** derives from **Transition State Theory**, relating rate constants to thermodynamic parameters of the transition state (\\(\\Delta H^\\ddagger\\), \\(\\Delta S^\\ddagger\\)), as depicted in panels (b) and (c) of the figure.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Role of Denaturation**  \n",
    "   - Both models in this notebook include a *logistic* denaturation factor to reduce active enzyme at high temperatures. Real systems can have more intricate denaturation kinetics, but this simple approach captures the key idea: above a certain threshold, enzyme function declines rapidly.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Bell-Shaped Curve**  \n",
    "   - Combining an **Arrhenius- or Eyring-like increase** at moderate temperatures with **denaturation** at higher temperatures typically yields the **bell-shaped** temperature-activity curve depicted in many enzyme-kinetics references.  \n",
    "   - As shown in panel (d), enzymatic rates may also be viewed in the context of substrate concentration and Michaelis–Menten parameters, but the main driver at high temperature is denaturation.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Parameter Interpretation**  \n",
    "   - **Arrhenius**: \\(E_a\\) (J/mol) is the activation energy barrier.  \n",
    "   - **Eyring**: \\(\\Delta H^\\ddagger\\) (J/mol) is the enthalpy of activation; \\(\\Delta S^\\ddagger\\) (J/(mol·K)) is the entropy of activation. A large positive \\(\\Delta S^\\ddagger\\) can lead to higher rates, while a large positive \\(\\Delta H^\\ddagger\\) lowers the rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Historical Significance**  \n",
    "   - **Arrhenius** (1889) built on **van ’t Hoff’s** work on temperature dependence of equilibrium constants and reaction rates.  \n",
    "   - **Henry Eyring** (1935) developed Transition State Theory, leading to the **Eyring-Polanyi equation**, providing a more fundamental theoretical underpinning for temperature-dependent rate processes in chemistry and biochemistry."

    "## 5. Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we have:\n",
    "- Incorporated insights from a **recent review figure** (panels (a)–(e)) showing Arrhenius, Eyring, and Michaelis–Menten perspectives.  \n",
    "- Shown how **Arrhenius** and **Eyring** equations each describe temperature-dependent reaction rates.  \n",
    "- Applied both to a simplified **enzyme kinetics** scenario, including a denaturation term.  \n",
    "- Provided interactive sliders to explore how parameters like \\(E_a\\), \\(\\Delta H^\\ddagger\\), \\(\\Delta S^\\ddagger\\), and the denaturation threshold affect the enzyme’s activity profile.\n",
    "\n",
    "The combination of these models, especially with the logistic denaturation factor, nicely illustrates the **bell-shaped** temperature dependence typically observed in real enzymes. As the attached figure shows, such analyses can be extended to full **Michaelis–Menten** kinetics (panel d) and to distinguishing **enthalpic** vs. **entropic** components of catalysis (panel e)."
