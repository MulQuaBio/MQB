# Introduction

Welcome to the Advanced data science Section!

Here would will build on the previous MQB sections to learn about important techniques in advanced data analysis and statistics.  

Here is a list of the prerequisite computing and mathematics skills and topics you need to be at least somewhat familiar with:

## Prerequisites

### Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian Methods in Ecology and Evolution

1. *Understanding and analysing functions* (e.g., as a ``height'' over a parameter space).

2. *Probability Theory*  
   - Manipulating probability distributions (joint, marginal, conditional) - Integrating PDF's.  
   - Familiarity with key distributions (e.g., Gaussian, Binomial, Poisson).

3. *Frequentist Hypothesis Testing*  
   - Understanding null and alternative hypotheses.  
   - Interpreting p-values and test statistics.

4. *Differential Equations*  
   - Setting up and analyzing first-order ordinary differential equations (ODEs).

### Machine Learning / AI for Ecology and Evolution

All of the above, and in addition,

5. *Function Minimization and Optimization*  
   - Knowing what it means to minimize a function (e.g., sum of squared errors).  
   - Understanding how parameters are searched in an optimization process.

3. *Linear Algebra: Eigenvectors and Eigenvalues*  
   - Familiarity with the definitions and significance of eigenvectors and eigenvalues.

4. *Computing and Software Installation Skills*  
   - Ability to troubleshoot R/Python environment setups.  
   - Installing and configuring libraries like Keras/TensorFlow in Linux/UNIX.
